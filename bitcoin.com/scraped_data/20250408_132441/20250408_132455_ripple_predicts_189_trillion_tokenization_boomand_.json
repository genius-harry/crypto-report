The report, developed in partnership with Boston Consulting Group (BCG), projects that tokenized real-world assets will expand from $0.6 trillion today to $18.9 trillion by 2033, reaching $9.4 trillion by 2030. The forecast points to a 53 percent compound annual growth rate, driven by institutional demand, evolving regulation, and advances in blockchain infrastructure. Ripple stated:\n\n> The financial world is undergoing a fundamental shift. A new report by Ripple … projects the market for tokenized real-world assets to grow from $0.6 trillion today to $18.9 trillion by 2033 ($9.4 trillion by 2030), with a CAGR of 53 percent.\n\nAccording to Ripple and BCG, the evolution of tokenized finance will unfold in three stages. The first phase focuses on institutional onboarding with familiar products like bonds and money market funds. In the second, institutions begin scaling into more complex asset classes such as private credit and real estate. The final phase envisions tokenization embedded throughout both financial and non-financial products, redefining how ownership, compliance, and transactions operate across sectors.\n\nTibor Merey, Managing Director and Partner at BCG, stated:\n\n> Tokenization is transforming financial assets into programmable, interoperable tools, recorded on shared digital ledgers. This enables 24/7 transactions, fractional ownership, and automated compliance.\n\nRipple’s Markus Infanger added: “The market is transitioning from tokenized assets simply sitting on-chain to integrating into real economic activity.”\n\nThe report identifies several growth catalysts accelerating adoption: regulatory clarity in the European Union, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Switzerland; mature technology infrastructure, including secure wallets and custody solutions; and increased fintech mergers and strategic banking investments. These forces create a “flywheel effect,” where institutional supply and investor interest reinforce each other. However, challenges remain, including infrastructure fragmentation and uneven global regulation. Despite this, BCG’s Bernhard Kronfellner stressed the urgency of moving from pilots to production: “Tokenization is no longer just a concept—it’s the foundation for the future of global finance.”\n",
