These developments come as escalating global trade tensions are already testing investor sentiment.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will implement reciprocal tariffs starting April 2, triggering fears of an economic slowdown and fueling a broader risk-off shift across global markets. With capital moving out of equities and into traditional safe havens, digital assets may struggle to hold current levels.\n\nLet’s analyze how low BTC, ETH, and XRP can go amid the ongoing trade war.\n\n## **Bitcoin Bear Flag Breakdown Hints $73K**\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has slipped from its bear flag pattern following its recent correction from yearly highs.\n\nAs of March 31, BTC/USD was trading near $81,830 on Bitstamp, confirming a breakdown below a multi-week upward-sloping channel. This setup followed a sharp down-move earlier in March and resembles a classic continuation structure.\n\n![BTC/USD daily price char](https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2025/03/BTCUSD_2025-03-31_11-56-23.png?func=crop&q=70)\n\n_BTC/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView_\n\nTechnically, the height of the initial decline, when projected from the breakdown point, yields a downside target near $73,000.\n\nMomentum indicators are flashing early warnings: the daily RSI is hovering around 40.89, signaling fading bullish strength.\n\n## **Ethereum Breaches Triangle Support, $1,690 in Sight**\n\nEthereum (ETH) has also fallen below a key support structure — an ascending triangle formed throughout March.\n\nTypically a bullish pattern, the triangle failed to deliver an upside breakout, instead unraveling below its rising trendline. As of writing, ETH/USD trades at $1,799, down nearly 0.4% daily.\n\n![ETH/USD three-day price chart](https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2025/03/ETHUSD_2025-03-31_12-01-19.png?func=crop&q=70)\n\n_ETH/USD three-day price chart. Source: TradingView_\n\nThe breakdown opens the door to a measured move toward $1,690, derived from the pattern’s height. RSI has dropped to 33.79, nearing oversold territory but still lacking signs of bullish divergence.\n\nThe declining buy volume, which has failed to support the uptrend through March, adds to the bearish pressure. A failed retest of the $2,000 level could confirm ETH’s bearish trajectory for the weeks ahead.\n\n## **XRP Faces Major Breakdown Risk From Triangle Pattern**\n\nXRP is facing heightened downside risk as it continues to trade near the lower boundary of a descending triangle — a pattern that often signals bearish continuation.\n\nXRP/USD is currently priced around $2.07, down over 6% in the past 24 hours. The pattern has developed over the past few months, marked by lower highs and consistent support near the $2.00 level.\n\n![XRP/USD three-day price chart](https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2025/03/XRPUSD_2025-03-31_12-04-13.png?func=crop&q=70)\n\n_XRP/USD three-day price chart. Source: TradingView_\n\nA decisive break below this support would validate the triangle structure and trigger a potential plunge toward $1.22, a move that represents a nearly 40% decline.\n\nThe RSI reading of 43.82 remains weak, and the broader volume structure shows declining buyer conviction. Unless bulls defend the $2.00 floor, XRP could be headed for a significant drawdown.\n\n## **Risk-Off Sentiment Deepens as Tariffs Loom**\n\nThe technical breakdowns across major cryptocurrencies come as global markets prepare for [Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariff rollout](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/bitcoin-may-slip-below-80k-as-trump-spooks-risk-traders-1507487), which begins April 2. While details remain sparse, the tariffs are expected to affect all countries and compound existing steel, aluminum, and autos levies.\n\nThis macro uncertainty prompts money managers to reduce exposure to equities and shift into safer assets such as [bonds](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/gold-price-hits-all-time-high-amid-falling-yields-and-weakening-us-dollar-1508115), [gold](https://www.fxempire.com/commodities/gold), and the [Japanese yen](https://www.fxempire.com/currencies/usd-jpy). As a result, stocks are in decline, with the [S&P 500 suffering its worst quarter since 2022](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/sp500-will-defensive-sectors-lead-again-as-traders-brace-for-trade-policy-clarity-1508086), shedding $5 trillion in market value since peaking on February 19.\n\n![S&amp;P 500 daily performance chart](https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2025/03/SPX_2025-03-31_12-23-53.png?func=crop&q=70)\n\n_S&P 500 daily performance chart. Source: TradingView_\n\nSigns of economic strain are beginning to surface. Last week’s data revealed a sharp drop in [U.S. consumer sentiment](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/michigan-consumer-sentiment-drops-to-57-0-sp500-tests-session-lows-1507885) and a surge in inflation expectations.\n\nMeanwhile, gold hit a record high of $3,115.97 per ounce, marking a 19% year-to-date rally with at least 15 new all-time highs. The yen has also gained 0.7% compared to the dollar as demand for haven currencies increases.\n\n![XAU/USD and JPY/USD daily price chart](https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2025/03/XAUUSD_2025-03-31_12-22-23.png?func=crop&q=70)\n\n_XAU/USD and JPY/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView_\n\nSince top cryptocurrencies have historically mirrored global risk-on trends, this deteriorating macro backdrop could amplify the downside already indicated by technical charts.\n\nUntil risk sentiment stabilizes or new bullish catalysts emerge, digital assets may remain vulnerable to further corrections.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n- [XRP News Today: SEC Silence Pressures XRP as Atkins Vote Nears; BTC Holds $83k](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/xrp-news-today-sec-silence-pressures-xrp-as-atkins-vote-nears-btc-holds-83k-1508366)\n- [Cardano Price Analysis: ADA Briefly Dips Below Bearish Pattern – Will it Lose $0.60?](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/cardano-price-analysis-ada-briefly-dips-below-bearish-pattern-will-it-lose-0-60-1508308)\n- [Toncoin Price News: TON Breakout of Key Resistance Could Result in 33% Gains](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/toncoin-price-news-ton-breakout-of-key-resistance-could-result-in-33-gains-1508275)\n\n## About the Author\n\n![](https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_avatar_/b2106d92be92e5d949f063180857bf06?w=62&h=62&gravity=smart)\n\n[Yashu Gola](https://www.fxempire.com/author/yashugola) author\n\nFollow\n\nYashu Gola is a crypto journalist and analyst with expertise in digital assets, blockchain, and macroeconomics.

These developments come as escalating global trade tensions are already testing investor sentiment.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will implement reciprocal tariffs starting April 2, triggering fears of an economic slowdown and fueling a broader risk-off shift across global markets. With capital moving out of equities and into traditional safe havens, digital assets may struggle to hold current levels.\n\nLet’s analyze how low BTC, ETH, and XRP can go amid the ongoing trade war.\n\n## **Bitcoin Bear Flag Breakdown Hints $73K**\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has slipped from its bear flag pattern following its recent correction from yearly highs.\n\nAs of March 31, BTC/USD was trading near $81,830 on Bitstamp, confirming a breakdown below a multi-week upward-sloping channel. This setup followed a sharp down-move earlier in March and resembles a classic continuation structure.\n\n![BTC/USD daily price char](https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2025/03/BTCUSD_2025-03-31_11-56-23.png?func=crop&q=70)\n\n_BTC/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView_\n\nTechnically, the height of the initial decline, when projected from the breakdown point, yields a downside target near $73,000.\n\nMomentum indicators are flashing early warnings: the daily RSI is hovering around 40.89, signaling fading bullish strength.\n\n## **Ethereum Breaches Triangle Support, $1,690 in Sight**\n\nEthereum (ETH) has also fallen below a key support structure — an ascending triangle formed throughout March.\n\nTypically a bullish pattern, the triangle failed to deliver an upside breakout, instead unraveling below its rising trendline. As of writing, ETH/USD trades at $1,799, down nearly 0.4% daily.\n\n![ETH/USD three-day price chart](https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2025/03/ETHUSD_2025-03-31_12-01-19.png?func=crop&q=70)\n\n_ETH/USD three-day price chart. Source: TradingView_\n\nThe breakdown opens the door to a measured move toward $1,690, derived from the pattern’s height. RSI has dropped to 33.79, nearing oversold territory but still lacking signs of bullish divergence.\n\nThe declining buy volume, which has failed to support the uptrend through March, adds to the bearish pressure. A failed retest of the $2,000 level could confirm ETH’s bearish trajectory for the weeks ahead.\n\n## **XRP Faces Major Breakdown Risk From Triangle Pattern**\n\nXRP is facing heightened downside risk as it continues to trade near the lower boundary of a descending triangle — a pattern that often signals bearish continuation.\n\nXRP/USD is currently priced around $2.07, down over 6% in the past 24 hours. The pattern has developed over the past few months, marked by lower highs and consistent support near the $2.00 level.\n\n![XRP/USD three-day price chart](https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2025/03/XRPUSD_2025-03-31_12-04-13.png?func=crop&q=70)\n\n_XRP/USD three-day price chart. Source: TradingView_\n\nA decisive break below this support would validate the triangle structure and trigger a potential plunge toward $1.22, a move that represents a nearly 40% decline.\n\nThe RSI reading of 43.82 remains weak, and the broader volume structure shows declining buyer conviction. Unless bulls defend the $2.00 floor, XRP could be headed for a significant drawdown.\n\n## **Risk-Off Sentiment Deepens as Tariffs Loom**\n\nThe technical breakdowns across major cryptocurrencies come as global markets prepare for [Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariff rollout](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/bitcoin-may-slip-below-80k-as-trump-spooks-risk-traders-1507487), which begins April 2. While details remain sparse, the tariffs are expected to affect all countries and compound existing steel, aluminum, and autos levies.\n\nThis macro uncertainty prompts money managers to reduce exposure to equities and shift into safer assets such as [bonds](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/gold-price-hits-all-time-high-amid-falling-yields-and-weakening-us-dollar-1508115), [gold](https://www.fxempire.com/commodities/gold), and the [Japanese yen](https://www.fxempire.com/currencies/usd-jpy). As a result, stocks are in decline, with the [S&P 500 suffering its worst quarter since 2022](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/sp500-will-defensive-sectors-lead-again-as-traders-brace-for-trade-policy-clarity-1508086), shedding $5 trillion in market value since peaking on February 19.\n\n![S&amp;P 500 daily performance chart](https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2025/03/SPX_2025-03-31_12-23-53.png?func=crop&q=70)\n\n_S&P 500 daily performance chart. Source: TradingView_\n\nSigns of economic strain are beginning to surface. Last week’s data revealed a sharp drop in [U.S. consumer sentiment](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/michigan-consumer-sentiment-drops-to-57-0-sp500-tests-session-lows-1507885) and a surge in inflation expectations.\n\nMeanwhile, gold hit a record high of $3,115.97 per ounce, marking a 19% year-to-date rally with at least 15 new all-time highs. The yen has also gained 0.7% compared to the dollar as demand for haven currencies increases.\n\n![XAU/USD and JPY/USD daily price chart](https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2025/03/XAUUSD_2025-03-31_12-22-23.png?func=crop&q=70)\n\n_XAU/USD and JPY/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView_\n\nSince top cryptocurrencies have historically mirrored global risk-on trends, this deteriorating macro backdrop could amplify the downside already indicated by technical charts.\n\nUntil risk sentiment stabilizes or new bullish catalysts emerge, digital assets may remain vulnerable to further corrections.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n- [XRP News Today: SEC Silence Pressures XRP as Atkins Vote Nears; BTC Holds $83k](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/xrp-news-today-sec-silence-pressures-xrp-as-atkins-vote-nears-btc-holds-83k-1508366)\n- [Cardano Price Analysis: ADA Briefly Dips Below Bearish Pattern – Will it Lose $0.60?](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/cardano-price-analysis-ada-briefly-dips-below-bearish-pattern-will-it-lose-0-60-1508308)\n- [Toncoin Price News: TON Breakout of Key Resistance Could Result in 33% Gains](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/toncoin-price-news-ton-breakout-of-key-resistance-could-result-in-33-gains-1508275)\n\n## About the Author\n\n![](https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_avatar_/b2106d92be92e5d949f063180857bf06?w=62&h=62&gravity=smart)\n\n[Yashu Gola](https://www.fxempire.com/author/yashugola) author\n\nFollow\n\nYashu Gola is a crypto journalist and analyst with expertise in digital assets, blockchain, and macroeconomics.

These developments come as escalating global trade tensions are already testing investor sentiment.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will implement reciprocal tariffs starting April 2, triggering fears of an economic slowdown and fueling a broader risk-off shift across global markets. With capital moving out of equities and into traditional safe havens, digital assets may struggle to hold current levels.\n\nLet’s analyze how low BTC, ETH, and XRP can go amid the ongoing trade war.\n\n## **Bitcoin Bear Flag Breakdown Hints $73K**\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has slipped from its bear flag pattern following its recent correction from yearly highs.\n\nAs of March 31, BTC/USD was trading near $81,830 on Bitstamp, confirming a breakdown below a multi-week upward-sloping channel. This setup followed a sharp down-move earlier in March and resembles a classic continuation structure.\n\n![BTC/USD daily price char](https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2025/03/BTCUSD_2025-03-31_11-56-23.png?func=crop&q=70)\n\n_BTC/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView_\n\nTechnically, the height of the initial decline, when projected from the breakdown point, yields a downside target near $73,000.\n\nMomentum indicators are flashing early warnings: the daily RSI is hovering around 40.89, signaling fading bullish strength.\n\n## **Ethereum Breaches Triangle Support, $1,690 in Sight**\n\nEthereum (ETH) has also fallen below a key support structure — an ascending triangle formed throughout March.\n\nTypically a bullish pattern, the triangle failed to deliver an upside breakout, instead unraveling below its rising trendline. As of writing, ETH/USD trades at $1,799, down nearly 0.4% daily.\n\n![ETH/USD three-day price chart](https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2025/03/ETHUSD_2025-03-31_12-01-19.png?func=crop&q=70)\n\n_ETH/USD three-day price chart. Source: TradingView_\n\nThe breakdown opens the door to a measured move toward $1,690, derived from the pattern’s height. RSI has dropped to 33.79, nearing oversold territory but still lacking signs of bullish divergence.\n\nThe declining buy volume, which has failed to support the uptrend through March, adds to the bearish pressure. A failed retest of the $2,000 level could confirm ETH’s bearish trajectory for the weeks ahead.\n\n## **XRP Faces Major Breakdown Risk From Triangle Pattern**\n\nXRP is facing heightened downside risk as it continues to trade near the lower boundary of a descending triangle — a pattern that often signals bearish continuation.\n\nXRP/USD is currently priced around $2.07, down over 6% in the past 24 hours. The pattern has developed over the past few months, marked by lower highs and consistent support near the $2.00 level.\n\n![XRP/USD three-day price chart](https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2025/03/XRPUSD_2025-03-31_12-04-13.png?func=crop&q=70)\n\n_XRP/USD three-day price chart. Source: TradingView_\n\nA decisive break below this support would validate the triangle structure and trigger a potential plunge toward $1.22, a move that represents a nearly 40% decline.\n\nThe RSI reading of 43.82 remains weak, and the broader volume structure shows declining buyer conviction. Unless bulls defend the $2.00 floor, XRP could be headed for a significant drawdown.\n\n## **Risk-Off Sentiment Deepens as Tariffs Loom**\n\nThe technical breakdowns across major cryptocurrencies come as global markets prepare for [Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariff rollout](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/bitcoin-may-slip-below-80k-as-trump-spooks-risk-traders-1507487), which begins April 2. While details remain sparse, the tariffs are expected to affect all countries and compound existing steel, aluminum, and autos levies.\n\nThis macro uncertainty prompts money managers to reduce exposure to equities and shift into safer assets such as [bonds](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/gold-price-hits-all-time-high-amid-falling-yields-and-weakening-us-dollar-1508115), [gold](https://www.fxempire.com/commodities/gold), and the [Japanese yen](https://www.fxempire.com/currencies/usd-jpy). As a result, stocks are in decline, with the [S&P 500 suffering its worst quarter since 2022](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/sp500-will-defensive-sectors-lead-again-as-traders-brace-for-trade-policy-clarity-1508086), shedding $5 trillion in market value since peaking on February 19.\n\n![S&amp;P 500 daily performance chart](https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2025/03/SPX_2025-03-31_12-23-53.png?func=crop&q=70)\n\n_S&P 500 daily performance chart. Source: TradingView_\n\nSigns of economic strain are beginning to surface. Last week’s data revealed a sharp drop in [U.S. consumer sentiment](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/michigan-consumer-sentiment-drops-to-57-0-sp500-tests-session-lows-1507885) and a surge in inflation expectations.\n\nMeanwhile, gold hit a record high of $3,115.97 per ounce, marking a 19% year-to-date rally with at least 15 new all-time highs. The yen has also gained 0.7% compared to the dollar as demand for haven currencies increases.\n\n![XAU/USD and JPY/USD daily price chart](https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2025/03/XAUUSD_2025-03-31_12-22-23.png?func=crop&q=70)\n\n_XAU/USD and JPY/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView_\n\nSince top cryptocurrencies have historically mirrored global risk-on trends, this deteriorating macro backdrop could amplify the downside already indicated by technical charts.\n\nUntil risk sentiment stabilizes or new bullish catalysts emerge, digital assets may remain vulnerable to further corrections.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n- [XRP News Today: SEC Silence Pressures XRP as Atkins Vote Nears; BTC Holds $83k](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/xrp-news-today-sec-silence-pressures-xrp-as-atkins-vote-nears-btc-holds-83k-1508366)\n- [Cardano Price Analysis: ADA Briefly Dips Below Bearish Pattern – Will it Lose $0.60?](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/cardano-price-analysis-ada-briefly-dips-below-bearish-pattern-will-it-lose-0-60-1508308)\n- [Toncoin Price News: TON Breakout of Key Resistance Could Result in 33% Gains](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/toncoin-price-news-ton-breakout-of-key-resistance-could-result-in-33-gains-1508275)\n\n## About the Author\n\n![](https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_avatar_/b2106d92be92e5d949f063180857bf06?w=62&h=62&gravity=smart)\n\n[Yashu Gola](https://www.fxempire.com/author/yashugola) author\n\nFollow\n\nYashu Gola is a crypto journalist and analyst with expertise in digital assets, blockchain, and macroeconomics.
