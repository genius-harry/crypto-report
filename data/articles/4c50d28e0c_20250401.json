If Bitcoin’s price fails to close above the $85,000 mark, it could amplify altcoin losses further.\n\n## Crypto news updates:\n\n## FDIC allows banks to engage in crypto activities without prior approval\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued new guidance on Friday clarifying that FDIC-supervised banks can engage in permissible crypto-related activities without requiring prior approval.\n\nThe announcement, outlined in the Financial Institution Letter (FIL-7-2025), replaces previous guidance from 2022 and aims to provide regulatory clarity for banks exploring digital assets.\n\nFDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill described the move as a shift away from the restrictive policies of recent years, signaling a more open stance toward blockchain and crypto adoption in the banking sector.\n\n## UAE unveils new dirham symbol ahead of digital currency rollout\n\nThe Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has introduced new symbols for the dirham in both its physical and digital forms, reinforcing the nation's financial identity and ambitions as a global payment hub.\n\nThe new symbol for the physical dirham incorporates the first letter of its English name with two horizontal lines, inspired by the UAE flag, symbolizing currency stability.\n\nThe digital dirham symbol, distinguished by a surrounding circle and UAE flag colors, marks a step towards the country’s digital currency adoption.\n\nWhile the Central Bank has yet to announce a specific rollout date for the digital dirham, the move aligns with the UAE’s broader strategy to modernize its financial system and enhance cross-border transactions.\n\n## Galaxy Digital settles $200 million with NY AG over LUNA promotion\n\nThe New York Attorney General’s office has reached a $200 million settlement with Galaxy Digital over its involvement in promoting LUNA, the failed algorithmic cryptocurrency that contributed to a $40 billion market collapse in 2022.\n\nThe settlement filing accuses Galaxy of violating the Martin Act and Executive Law by failing to disclose its financial interest in the asset while promoting it.\n\nGalaxy Digital, founded by Michael Novogratz, was one of the most prominent crypto investment firms tied to LUNA’s rise and fall. Terraform Labs, the creator of LUNA and its associated stablecoin TerraUSD (UST), saw its ecosystem implode when the algorithmic mechanism underpinning UST failed. Do Kwon, Terraform’s founder, remains detained in Montenegro, awaiting extradition to face fraud and securities charges in the US.\n\n## French state bank launches fund to invest in smaller cryptocurrencies\n\nFrance’s state-owned investment bank, Bpifrance, announced plans to allocate up to €25 million ($26.95 million) for direct investments in lesser-known cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis marks the bank’s first dedicated crypto fund, following previous €150 million investments in blockchain-related projects.\n\nThe initiative aims to support emerging French crypto ventures by purchasing tokens before they are listed on exchanges.\n\nArnaud Caudoux, Bpifrance’s deputy CEO, emphasized the strategic importance of this move, citing the rapid acceleration of crypto policies in the United States.\n\nThe fund aligns with France’s broader efforts to position itself as a leader in blockchain innovation, with government officials reaffirming their commitment to fostering a competitive digital economy.\n\n* * *\n\nShare:Share on WhatsAppShare on TelegramCopy to clipboardCopied\n\nLinkedin\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nReddit\n\n[Email](mailto:?body=Crypto%C2%A0market%C2%A0liquidations%C2%A0%7C%C2%A0March%C2%A028%C2%A0The%C2%A0losses%C2%A0sparked%C2%A0over%C2%A0%24449%C2%A0million%C2%A0in%C2%A0liquidations%C2%A0across%C2%A0the%C2%A0crypto%C2%A0derivatives%C2%A0markets.%C2%A0%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fxstreet.com%2Fcryptocurrencies%2Fnews%2Fcrypto-today-xrp-sol-and-eth-prices-tumble-as-south-carolina-moves-to-buy-up-to-1-million-btc-202503282352&subject=Crypto%20Today:%20XRP,%20SOL%20and%20ETH%20prices%20tumble%20as%20South%20Carolina%20moves%20to%20buy%20up%20to%201%20million%20BTC)\n[Cryptos feed](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/feed)\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

If Bitcoin’s price fails to close above the $85,000 mark, it could amplify altcoin losses further.\n\n## Crypto news updates:\n\n## FDIC allows banks to engage in crypto activities without prior approval\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued new guidance on Friday clarifying that FDIC-supervised banks can engage in permissible crypto-related activities without requiring prior approval.\n\nThe announcement, outlined in the Financial Institution Letter (FIL-7-2025), replaces previous guidance from 2022 and aims to provide regulatory clarity for banks exploring digital assets.\n\nFDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill described the move as a shift away from the restrictive policies of recent years, signaling a more open stance toward blockchain and crypto adoption in the banking sector.\n\n## UAE unveils new dirham symbol ahead of digital currency rollout\n\nThe Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has introduced new symbols for the dirham in both its physical and digital forms, reinforcing the nation's financial identity and ambitions as a global payment hub.\n\nThe new symbol for the physical dirham incorporates the first letter of its English name with two horizontal lines, inspired by the UAE flag, symbolizing currency stability.\n\nThe digital dirham symbol, distinguished by a surrounding circle and UAE flag colors, marks a step towards the country’s digital currency adoption.\n\nWhile the Central Bank has yet to announce a specific rollout date for the digital dirham, the move aligns with the UAE’s broader strategy to modernize its financial system and enhance cross-border transactions.\n\n## Galaxy Digital settles $200 million with NY AG over LUNA promotion\n\nThe New York Attorney General’s office has reached a $200 million settlement with Galaxy Digital over its involvement in promoting LUNA, the failed algorithmic cryptocurrency that contributed to a $40 billion market collapse in 2022.\n\nThe settlement filing accuses Galaxy of violating the Martin Act and Executive Law by failing to disclose its financial interest in the asset while promoting it.\n\nGalaxy Digital, founded by Michael Novogratz, was one of the most prominent crypto investment firms tied to LUNA’s rise and fall. Terraform Labs, the creator of LUNA and its associated stablecoin TerraUSD (UST), saw its ecosystem implode when the algorithmic mechanism underpinning UST failed. Do Kwon, Terraform’s founder, remains detained in Montenegro, awaiting extradition to face fraud and securities charges in the US.\n\n## French state bank launches fund to invest in smaller cryptocurrencies\n\nFrance’s state-owned investment bank, Bpifrance, announced plans to allocate up to €25 million ($26.95 million) for direct investments in lesser-known cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis marks the bank’s first dedicated crypto fund, following previous €150 million investments in blockchain-related projects.\n\nThe initiative aims to support emerging French crypto ventures by purchasing tokens before they are listed on exchanges.\n\nArnaud Caudoux, Bpifrance’s deputy CEO, emphasized the strategic importance of this move, citing the rapid acceleration of crypto policies in the United States.\n\nThe fund aligns with France’s broader efforts to position itself as a leader in blockchain innovation, with government officials reaffirming their commitment to fostering a competitive digital economy.\n\n* * *\n\nShare:Share on WhatsAppShare on TelegramCopy to clipboardCopied\n\nLinkedin\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nReddit\n\n[Email](mailto:?body=Crypto%C2%A0market%C2%A0liquidations%C2%A0%7C%C2%A0March%C2%A028%C2%A0The%C2%A0losses%C2%A0sparked%C2%A0over%C2%A0%24449%C2%A0million%C2%A0in%C2%A0liquidations%C2%A0across%C2%A0the%C2%A0crypto%C2%A0derivatives%C2%A0markets.%C2%A0%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fxstreet.com%2Fcryptocurrencies%2Fnews%2Fcrypto-today-xrp-sol-and-eth-prices-tumble-as-south-carolina-moves-to-buy-up-to-1-million-btc-202503282352&subject=Crypto%20Today:%20XRP,%20SOL%20and%20ETH%20prices%20tumble%20as%20South%20Carolina%20moves%20to%20buy%20up%20to%201%20million%20BTC)\n[Cryptos feed](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/feed)\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
