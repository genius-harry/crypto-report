Inflation forecasts were also revised higher, signaling a cautious outlook from\npolicymakers.\n\n\"The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased, FOMC statement read. \"The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.\"\n\nAdditionally, the institution also announced plans to\nslow the pace of its balance sheet runoff starting in April, adding another\nlayer of complexity to its monetary policy approach. The Fed’s latest economic projections now see U.S. GDP growing just 1.7%\nin 2025, down from the 2.1% forecast in December.\n\nGrowth estimates for 2026 and 2027 were also trimmed,\nreflecting growing uncertainty about the economic trajectory. “As with real activity and [inflation](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/inflation/), the outlook for\nthe future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable\nuncertainty,” the Fed stated, hinting at concerns over trade policies and other\nglobal economic risks.\n\n## Economic Growth and Inflation\n\nDespite economic headwinds, the Fed’s projections suggest policymakers still anticipate ending 2025 with a benchmark interest rate of 3.9%, implying only two rate cuts by year-end. The forecasts for 2026 and 2027 stand at 3.4% and 3.1%, respectively, reinforcing expectations that borrowing costs will remain elevated in the near term.\n\n![](https://images.financemagnates.com/images/Crypto%20reacts%20as%20Fed%20holds%20interest%20rates%20steady.jpg_id_198c4006-fdeb-4079-bfcf-0815895a4a9b_size900.jpg)\n\nCrypto reacts as Fed holds interest rates steady\n\nIn December, the central bank [forecast inflation at 2.5% for 2025 and GDP growth at 2.1%](https://www.financemagnates.com/trending/can-bitcoin-hold-100k-price-drops-as-fed-slashes-rates-again/). Given recent economic data, there is\nspeculation that the Fed may raise its inflation outlook while lowering its\ngrowth expectations.\n\nWith uncertainty surrounding economic growth,\ninflation, and future rate moves, the FOMC's latest meeting is now shaping investor sentiment. For crypto traders, the short-term volatility might\nbe significant, but in the broader context of digital asset markets, it remains\nbusiness as usual.\n\nThe Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate steady\nfor a second consecutive meeting, signaling concerns about slower economic\ngrowth and persistent inflation pressures.

Inflation forecasts were also revised higher, signaling a cautious outlook from\npolicymakers.\n\n\"The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased, FOMC statement read. \"The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.\"\n\nAdditionally, the institution also announced plans to\nslow the pace of its balance sheet runoff starting in April, adding another\nlayer of complexity to its monetary policy approach. The Fed’s latest economic projections now see U.S. GDP growing just 1.7%\nin 2025, down from the 2.1% forecast in December.\n\nGrowth estimates for 2026 and 2027 were also trimmed,\nreflecting growing uncertainty about the economic trajectory. “As with real activity and [inflation](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/inflation/), the outlook for\nthe future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable\nuncertainty,” the Fed stated, hinting at concerns over trade policies and other\nglobal economic risks.\n\n## Economic Growth and Inflation\n\nDespite economic headwinds, the Fed’s projections suggest policymakers still anticipate ending 2025 with a benchmark interest rate of 3.9%, implying only two rate cuts by year-end. The forecasts for 2026 and 2027 stand at 3.4% and 3.1%, respectively, reinforcing expectations that borrowing costs will remain elevated in the near term.\n\nCrypto reacts as Fed holds interest rates steady\n\nIn December, the central bank [forecast inflation at 2.5% for 2025 and GDP growth at 2.1%](https://www.financemagnates.com/trending/can-bitcoin-hold-100k-price-drops-as-fed-slashes-rates-again/). Given recent economic data, there is\nspeculation that the Fed may raise its inflation outlook while lowering its\ngrowth expectations.\n\nWith uncertainty surrounding economic growth,\ninflation, and future rate moves, the FOMC's latest meeting is now shaping investor sentiment. For crypto traders, the short-term volatility might\nbe significant, but in the broader context of digital asset markets, it remains\nbusiness as usual.\n\nTopics\n\n\n[bitcoin](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/bitcoin/) [Ethereum](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/ethereum/) [federal reserve](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/federal-reserve/)\n\nShare this article\n\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Bitcoin%2C%20Ethereum%2C%20XRP%20Surge%20As%20Fed%20Holds%20Interest%20Rates%20Steady&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F&hashtags=finance_magnates,fm&via=finance_magnates)\n\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F&title=Bitcoin%2C%20Ethereum%2C%20XRP%20Surge%20As%20Fed%20Holds%20Interest%20Rates%20Steady&summary=The%20Fed%20highlighted%20the%20concerns%20about%20slower%20economic%20growth%20and%20persistent%20inflation%20pressures.%0AAmid%20the%20announcement%2C%20cryptocurrencies%20market%20surged%2C%20with%20XRP%20leading%20by%20double-digit%20growth%20in%20the%20past%20day.)\n\n[Email](mailto:?subject=You%27re%20going%20to%20love%20it%3A%20Bitcoin%2C%20Ethereum%2C%20XRP%20Surge%20As%20Fed%20Holds%20Interest%20Rates%20Steady&body=Check%20out%20this%20article%20from%20Finance%20Magnates%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F)\n\n[Telegram](https://t.me/share/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F&text=Bitcoin%2C%20Ethereum%2C%20XRP%20Surge%20As%20Fed%20Holds%20Interest%20Rates%20Steady)\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F)\n\n[WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F)\n\n[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F&title=Bitcoin%2C%20Ethereum%2C%20XRP%20Surge%20As%20Fed%20Holds%20Interest%20Rates%20Steady)\n\nDisqus Comments\n\nWe were unable to load Disqus.

Inflation forecasts were also revised higher, signaling a cautious outlook from\npolicymakers.\n\n\"The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased, FOMC statement read. \"The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.\"\n\nAdditionally, the institution also announced plans to\nslow the pace of its balance sheet runoff starting in April, adding another\nlayer of complexity to its monetary policy approach. The Fed’s latest economic projections now see U.S. GDP growing just 1.7%\nin 2025, down from the 2.1% forecast in December.\n\nGrowth estimates for 2026 and 2027 were also trimmed,\nreflecting growing uncertainty about the economic trajectory. “As with real activity and [inflation](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/inflation/), the outlook for\nthe future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable\nuncertainty,” the Fed stated, hinting at concerns over trade policies and other\nglobal economic risks.\n\n## Economic Growth and Inflation\n\nDespite economic headwinds, the Fed’s projections suggest policymakers still anticipate ending 2025 with a benchmark interest rate of 3.9%, implying only two rate cuts by year-end. The forecasts for 2026 and 2027 stand at 3.4% and 3.1%, respectively, reinforcing expectations that borrowing costs will remain elevated in the near term.\n\n![](https://images.financemagnates.com/images/Crypto%20reacts%20as%20Fed%20holds%20interest%20rates%20steady.jpg_id_198c4006-fdeb-4079-bfcf-0815895a4a9b_size900.jpg)\n\nCrypto reacts as Fed holds interest rates steady\n\nIn December, the central bank [forecast inflation at 2.5% for 2025 and GDP growth at 2.1%](https://www.financemagnates.com/trending/can-bitcoin-hold-100k-price-drops-as-fed-slashes-rates-again/). Given recent economic data, there is\nspeculation that the Fed may raise its inflation outlook while lowering its\ngrowth expectations.\n\nWith uncertainty surrounding economic growth,\ninflation, and future rate moves, the FOMC's latest meeting is now shaping investor sentiment. For crypto traders, the short-term volatility might\nbe significant, but in the broader context of digital asset markets, it remains\nbusiness as usual.\n\nThe Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate steady\nfor a second consecutive meeting, signaling concerns about slower economic\ngrowth and persistent inflation pressures. While the central bank opted not to\nraise borrowing costs further, it also adjusted its balance sheet policy, a\nmove that reportedly drew internal dissent.\n\n## Crypto Market Reacts\n\nAmid the announcement, the cryptocurrency market has shown renewed optimism as prices of major cryptocurrencies surged. At the time of publication, [Bitcoin](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/bitcoin/) was up 4% in\nthe past day at $84K. Ethereum has also gained 8%, trading at $2,034, while XRP is\nleading the surge after soaring 10% to $2.47 in the same period.\n\nTwitter Embed\n\n[Visit this post on X](https://twitter.com/federalreserve/status/1902420520299327980?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1902420520299327980%7Ctwgr%5E9c2a19a92e24a9cbb48a29be7a6c0cd57c2c47d6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F)\n\n[Federal Reserve](https://twitter.com/federalreserve?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1902420520299327980%7Ctwgr%5E9c2a19a92e24a9cbb48a29be7a6c0cd57c2c47d6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F)\n\n[@federalreserve](https://twitter.com/federalreserve?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1902420520299327980%7Ctwgr%5E9c2a19a92e24a9cbb48a29be7a6c0cd57c2c47d6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F)\n\n·\n\n[Follow](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1902420520299327980%7Ctwgr%5E9c2a19a92e24a9cbb48a29be7a6c0cd57c2c47d6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F&screen_name=federalreserve)\n\n[View on X](https://twitter.com/federalreserve/status/1902420520299327980?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1902420520299327980%7Ctwgr%5E9c2a19a92e24a9cbb48a29be7a6c0cd57c2c47d6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F)\n\nEconomic Projections of Federal Reserve Board Members and Federal Reserve Bank Presidents:\n\n[federalreserve.gov\\\\\n\\\\\nFederal Reserve Board and Federal Open Market Committee release economic projections from the March...](https://t.co/ncljvezHDI)\n\n[6:02 PM · Mar 19, 2025](https://twitter.com/federalreserve/status/1902420520299327980?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1902420520299327980%7Ctwgr%5E9c2a19a92e24a9cbb48a29be7a6c0cd57c2c47d6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F)\n\n[X Ads info and privacy](https://help.twitter.com/en/twitter-for-websites-ads-info-and-privacy)\n\n[155](https://twitter.com/intent/like?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1902420520299327980%7Ctwgr%5E9c2a19a92e24a9cbb48a29be7a6c0cd57c2c47d6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F&tweet_id=1902420520299327980) [Reply](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1902420520299327980%7Ctwgr%5E9c2a19a92e24a9cbb48a29be7a6c0cd57c2c47d6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F&in_reply_to=1902420520299327980)\n\nCopy link\n\n[Read 19 replies](https://twitter.com/federalreserve/status/1902420520299327980?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1902420520299327980%7Ctwgr%5E9c2a19a92e24a9cbb48a29be7a6c0cd57c2c47d6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F)\n\n> Economic Projections of Federal Reserve Board Members and Federal Reserve Bank Presidents: [https://t.co/ncljvezHDI](https://t.co/ncljvezHDI)\n>\n> — Federal Reserve (@federalreserve) [March 19, 2025](https://twitter.com/federalreserve/status/1902420520299327980?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nFed maintained its benchmark fed funds rate range at 4.25%-4.50% and slashed growth expectations. Inflation forecasts were also revised higher, signaling a cautious outlook from\npolicymakers.\n\n\"The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased, FOMC statement read. \"The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.\"\n\nAdditionally, the institution also announced plans to\nslow the pace of its balance sheet runoff starting in April, adding another\nlayer of complexity to its monetary policy approach. The Fed’s latest economic projections now see U.S. GDP growing just 1.7%\nin 2025, down from the 2.1% forecast in December.\n\nGrowth estimates for 2026 and 2027 were also trimmed,\nreflecting growing uncertainty about the economic trajectory. “As with real activity and [inflation](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/inflation/), the outlook for\nthe future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable\nuncertainty,” the Fed stated, hinting at concerns over trade policies and other\nglobal economic risks.\n\n## Economic Growth and Inflation\n\nDespite economic headwinds, the Fed’s projections suggest policymakers still anticipate ending 2025 with a benchmark interest rate of 3.9%, implying only two rate cuts by year-end. The forecasts for 2026 and 2027 stand at 3.4% and 3.1%, respectively, reinforcing expectations that borrowing costs will remain elevated in the near term.\n\nCrypto reacts as Fed holds interest rates steady\n\nIn December, the central bank [forecast inflation at 2.5% for 2025 and GDP growth at 2.1%](https://www.financemagnates.com/trending/can-bitcoin-hold-100k-price-drops-as-fed-slashes-rates-again/). Given recent economic data, there is\nspeculation that the Fed may raise its inflation outlook while lowering its\ngrowth expectations.\n\nWith uncertainty surrounding economic growth,\ninflation, and future rate moves, the FOMC's latest meeting is now shaping investor sentiment.

Inflation forecasts were also revised higher, signaling a cautious outlook from\npolicymakers.\n\n\"The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased, FOMC statement read. \"The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.\"\n\nAdditionally, the institution also announced plans to\nslow the pace of its balance sheet runoff starting in April, adding another\nlayer of complexity to its monetary policy approach. The Fed’s latest economic projections now see U.S. GDP growing just 1.7%\nin 2025, down from the 2.1% forecast in December.\n\nGrowth estimates for 2026 and 2027 were also trimmed,\nreflecting growing uncertainty about the economic trajectory. “As with real activity and [inflation](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/inflation/), the outlook for\nthe future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable\nuncertainty,” the Fed stated, hinting at concerns over trade policies and other\nglobal economic risks.\n\n## Economic Growth and Inflation\n\nDespite economic headwinds, the Fed’s projections suggest policymakers still anticipate ending 2025 with a benchmark interest rate of 3.9%, implying only two rate cuts by year-end.

Inflation forecasts were also revised higher, signaling a cautious outlook from\npolicymakers.\n\n\"The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased, FOMC statement read. \"The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.\"\n\nAdditionally, the institution also announced plans to\nslow the pace of its balance sheet runoff starting in April, adding another\nlayer of complexity to its monetary policy approach. The Fed’s latest economic projections now see U.S. GDP growing just 1.7%\nin 2025, down from the 2.1% forecast in December.\n\nGrowth estimates for 2026 and 2027 were also trimmed,\nreflecting growing uncertainty about the economic trajectory. “As with real activity and [inflation](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/inflation/), the outlook for\nthe future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable\nuncertainty,” the Fed stated, hinting at concerns over trade policies and other\nglobal economic risks.\n\n## Economic Growth and Inflation\n\nDespite economic headwinds, the Fed’s projections suggest policymakers still anticipate ending 2025 with a benchmark interest rate of 3.9%, implying only two rate cuts by year-end. The forecasts for 2026 and 2027 stand at 3.4% and 3.1%, respectively, reinforcing expectations that borrowing costs will remain elevated in the near term.\n\nCrypto reacts as Fed holds interest rates steady\n\nIn December, the central bank [forecast inflation at 2.5% for 2025 and GDP growth at 2.1%](https://www.financemagnates.com/trending/can-bitcoin-hold-100k-price-drops-as-fed-slashes-rates-again/).

The Fed’s latest economic projections now see U.S. GDP growing just 1.7% in 2025, down from the 2.1% forecast in December.\n\nGrowth estimates for 2026 and 2027 were also trimmed, reflecting growing uncertainty about the economic trajectory. “As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty,” the Fed stated, hinting at concerns over trade policies and other global economic risks.\n\n[News.Az](https://news.az/)\n\n- [Fed](https://news.az/tag/fed)\n- [interest rates](https://news.az/tag/interest_rates)\n- [Bitcoin](https://news.az/tag/bitcoin)\n- [Ethereum](https://news.az/tag/ethereum)\n- [XRP](https://news.az/tag/xrp)\n- [cryptocurrency](https://news.az/tag/cryptocurrency)\n- [crypto market](https://news.az/tag/crypto_market)\n\n- [Share news on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://news.az/news/bitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-after-fed-rate-decision \"Share news on Facebook\")\n- [Share news on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Bitcoin,%20Ethereum,%20XRP%20surge%20after%20Fed%20rate%20decision%20-%20https://news.az/news/bitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-after-fed-rate-decision \"Share news on Twitter\")\n- [Share news on Whatsapp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Bitcoin,%20Ethereum,%20XRP%20surge%20after%20Fed%20rate%20decision%20-%20https://news.az/news/bitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-after-fed-rate-decision \"Share news on Whatsapp\")\n- [Share news on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://news.az/news/bitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-after-fed-rate-decision \"Share news on Linkedin\")\n- [Share news on Telegram](https://telegram.me/share/url?url=https://news.az/news/bitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-after-fed-rate-decision&text=Bitcoin,%20Ethereum,%20XRP%20surge%20after%20Fed%20rate%20decision \"Share news on Telegram\")\n\n[![](https://news.az/img/t700.gif)](https://bit.ly/3QrVY2U)\n\n[iframe](https://platform.twitter.com/widgets/widget_iframe.2f70fb173b9000da126c79afe2098f02.html?origin=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.az)",

Tron’s TRX dipped after a surge 5% earlier in the day as memecoin trading picked up on the blockchain following a [no-fee update](https://www.coindesk.com/daybook-us/2025/03/19/crypto-daybook-americas-memecoins-take-off-on-tron-while-bitcoin-looks-to-fomc) in the Sunpump platform.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) rose 2% and remained steady under $84,000 in Asian evening hours ahead of the FOMC, where traders expect rates to be held steady. The $80,000 mark remains one to be watched, some say, as a break below would mean a critical support level vanishes.\n\nThe widely-watched ETH/BTC ratio - or the trading pair of ether against bitcoin - rose from 0.23 to 0.24 since Asian morning hours, indicative of a bump in demand for riskier ETH versus the perceived safety of bitcoin.\n\nEther rose on no immediate catalyst, but the mothership network has technical catalysts in the making. The Pectra upgrade, Ethereum's next major update, is currently in testing and aims to improve scalability, staking, and user experience with over 20 EIPs, including EIP-7702 (smart account functionality) and EIP-7251 (raising validator staking limits to 2,048 ETH).\n\nTesting began on Holesky in February 2025, followed by Sepolia in March, but faced challenges like transaction processing issues due to client incompatibilities. A new testnet, Hooli, launched on March 17, with Pectra testing scheduled for March 26. If successful, mainnet deployment is expected in late April or early May 2025.\n\n“BTC has found some support at the $80K, but that seems tenuous at best amid broader macro weakness,” traders at Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a broadcast message. “We won’t attempt to call the exact moment when the music stops, but in the short term, we struggle to identify meaningful tailwinds to reverse this rout.”\n\n“We will be watching closely for any dovish shifts, particularly on growth and inflation expectations. Given that it will take months for the impact of tariffs to ripple through the economy, we expect the Fed to remain in “wait-and-see” mode,” QCP added.\n\nMeanwhile, gold broke above $3,000 to new highs earlier Wednesday, leading to some eyeing an inverse correlation of the yellow metal with bitcoin.\n\n“Despite its historical correlation with gold as a macro hedge, Bitcoin's current divergence—falling while gold rises—suggests it's acting more like a risk asset, influenced by Fed policy uncertainty, profit-taking, and a shift to traditional safe-havens,” Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.\n\n“The FOMC outcome could either trigger a recovery if dovish or deepen the correction if hawkish, with bitcoin's short-term trajectory tied to broader economic signals rather than solely reinforcing its \"digital gold\" role,” Lee added.\n\n[Ether](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/ether) [Bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/bitcoin) [FOMC](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/fomc)\n\n##### [Shaurya Malwa](https://www.coindesk.com/author/shaurya-malwa)\n\nShaurya is the Co-Leader of the CoinDesk tokens and data team in Asia with a focus on crypto derivatives, DeFi, market microstructure, and protocol analysis.\n\nShaurya holds over $1,000 in BTC, ETH, SOL, AVAX, SUSHI, CRV, NEAR, YFI, YFII, SHIB, DOGE, USDT, USDC, BNB, MANA, MLN, LINK, XMR, ALGO, VET, CAKE, AAVE, COMP, ROOK, TRX, SNX, RUNE, FTM, ZIL, KSM, ENJ, CKB, JOE, GHST, PERP, BTRFLY, OHM, BANANA, ROME, BURGER, SPIRIT, and ORCA.\n\nHe provides over $1,000 to liquidity pools on Compound, Curve, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, BurgerSwap, Orca, AnySwap, SpiritSwap, Rook Protocol, Yearn Finance, Synthetix, Harvest, Redacted Cartel, OlympusDAO, Rome, Trader Joe, and SUN.\n\n[X icon](https://x.com/shauryamalwa \"X\") [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaurya-malwa-a78101102/ \"LinkedIn\") [Email](mailto:shaurya.malwa@coindesk.com \"Email\")\n\n[![Shaurya Malwa](https://www.coindesk.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2F1c7e071b6b9ef4d849b5edaa9d644a67043efe54-512x512.png%3Fw%3D64%26h%3D64%26fit%3Dcrop%26crop%3Dfocalpoint%26auto%3Dformat&w=1080&q=75)](https://www.coindesk.com/author/shaurya-malwa)\n\n[iframe](https://consentcdn.cookiebot.com/sdk/bc-v4.min.html)",

Three of the most-watched (and most valuable) tokens today are **Bitcoin**(CRYPTO: BTC), **Ethereum**(CRYPTO: ETH) and **Dogecoin**(CRYPTO: DOGE). These digital assets have lost 2.9%, 2.8%, and 5.7%, respectively, over the past 24 hours as of 3 p.m. ET.\n\nThese moves have coincided with a broader pause in other risk assets ahead of what should be a very influential Federal Reserve decision tomorrow. But as is always the case with these high-flying assets, there's more to the story.\n\nLet's dive into some of the key drivers affecting demand for these three top cryptos today.\n\n## ETF flows generating outsized attention\n\nFollowing the post-Trump election victory, which saw Bitcoin rise to new all-time highs, and other top tokens like Ethereum and Dogecoin also see their fair share of upside, the performance of these top three cryptocurrencies has been overtly negative since Inauguration Day.\n\nSome of this depressed sentiment can be tied to spot ETF inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum. Among the notable reports I've seen come through is one detailing the surge of capital into gold-denominated ETFs and assets, with ETF outflows from various Bitcoin ETFs presumably flowing into these safe-haven funds.\n\nOne of the key investing theses held by long-term Bitcoin bulls (and to a certain extent, Ethereum holders as well) is that these digital assets carry some \"store of value\" properties that should provide demand even in the worst market environments. In fairness, we've yet to see how any cryptocurrency performs in a prolonged bear market (Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency, created in 2009 following the GFC).\n\nThat said, the fact that spot Bitcoin ETFs have given up their lead over gold ETFs (which was first gained late last year following the Trump election victory) is a trend worth noting. If more capital continues to flow out of this space, spot Ethereum ETFs (and future potential spot ETFs for Dogecoin and other assets) may have a much more negative outlook. Indeed, the recent news that two Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs are being liquidated by 21Shares adds to this narrative.\n\n## What to make of these recession concerns?\n\nI think the price action of all three major tokens today, and for the better part of the past two months, is really indicative of how investors view cryptocurrencies as an asset class in a potential recession. Right now, market participants are increasingly attempting to price new recession probabilities into their models. For top cryptos like these, their performance in a protracted downturn is really not known. That's adding to the uncertainty around owning these assets heading into what could be a turbulent back half of 2025.\n\nStory Continues\n\nI think Bitcoin and Ethereum should have plenty of long-term upside. But I'm also aware that these assets have posted multiple 50%-plus drawdowns in the past, on lesser news than concerns around a potential recession. So investors will have to hone in on their investing timeline and what sort of levels they'd consider buying these assets at first before jumping in with both feet.\n\nMy view of Dogecoin is that this meme token is more of a speculative tool for traders to play sentiment to the upside and downside. Today's outsized move lower is indicative of how this token trades (with plenty of leveraged derivatives positions in the background driving these volatile moves).\n\nIf you're of the mind that more downside is likely, buying the dip with the world's two most valuable cryptocurrencies may be the strategy of choice.\n\n## Should you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe _Motley Fool Stock Advisor_ analyst team just identified what they believe are the **[10 best stocks](https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&impression=55981e0d-3c7f-484c-855e-85f65022d943&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-sa-bbn-bn%3Faid%3D8867%26source%3Disaeditxt0001029%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Darticle_pitch_feed_yahoo%26ftm_pit%3D17177&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=9c34ac48-04cc-48dc-af8d-993ede4c9e44)** for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

But as is always the case with these high-flying assets, there's more to the story.\n\nLet's dive into some of the key drivers affecting demand for these three top cryptos today.\n\n## ETF flows generating outsized attention\n\nFollowing the post-Trump election victory, which saw Bitcoin rise to new all-time highs, and other top tokens like Ethereum and Dogecoin also see their fair share of upside, the performance of these top three cryptocurrencies has been overtly negative since Inauguration Day.\n\nSome of this depressed sentiment can be tied to spot ETF inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum. Among the notable reports I've seen come through is one detailing the surge of capital into gold-denominated ETFs and assets, with ETF outflows from various Bitcoin ETFs presumably flowing into these safe-haven funds.\n\nOne of the key investing theses held by long-term Bitcoin bulls (and to a certain extent, Ethereum holders as well) is that these digital assets carry some \"store of value\" properties that should provide demand even in the worst market environments. In fairness, we've yet to see how any cryptocurrency performs in a prolonged bear market (Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency, created in 2009 following the GFC).\n\nThat said, the fact that spot Bitcoin ETFs have given up their lead over gold ETFs (which was first gained late last year following the Trump election victory) is a trend worth noting. If more capital continues to flow out of this space, spot Ethereum ETFs (and future potential spot ETFs for Dogecoin and other assets) may have a much more negative outlook. Indeed, the recent news that two Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs are being liquidated by 21Shares adds to this narrative.\n\n## What to make of these recession concerns?\n\nI think the price action of all three major tokens today, and for the better part of the past two months, is really indicative of how investors view cryptocurrencies as an asset class in a potential recession. Right now, market participants are increasingly attempting to price new recession probabilities into their models. For top cryptos like these, their performance in a protracted downturn is really not known. That's adding to the uncertainty around owning these assets heading into what could be a turbulent back half of 2025.\n\nStory Continues\n\nI think Bitcoin and Ethereum should have plenty of long-term upside. But I'm also aware that these assets have posted multiple 50%-plus drawdowns in the past, on lesser news than concerns around a potential recession. So investors will have to hone in on their investing timeline and what sort of levels they'd consider buying these assets at first before jumping in with both feet.\n\nMy view of Dogecoin is that this meme token is more of a speculative tool for traders to play sentiment to the upside and downside. Today's outsized move lower is indicative of how this token trades (with plenty of leveraged derivatives positions in the background driving these volatile moves).\n\nIf you're of the mind that more downside is likely, buying the dip with the world's two most valuable cryptocurrencies may be the strategy of choice.\n\n## Should you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe _Motley Fool Stock Advisor_ analyst team just identified what they believe are the **[10 best stocks](https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&impression=55981e0d-3c7f-484c-855e-85f65022d943&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-sa-bbn-bn%3Faid%3D8867%26source%3Disaeditxt0001029%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Darticle_pitch_feed_yahoo%26ftm_pit%3D17177&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=9c34ac48-04cc-48dc-af8d-993ede4c9e44)** for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

Three of the most-watched (and most valuable) tokens today are **Bitcoin**( [BTC](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/btc/) -2.68%), **Ethereum**( [ETH](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/eth/) -5.89%) and **Dogecoin**( [DOGE](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/doge/) -7.29%). These digital assets have lost 2.9%, 2.8%, and 5.7%, respectively, over the past 24 hours as of 3 p.m. ET.\n\nThese moves have coincided with a broader pause in other risk assets ahead of what should be a very influential Federal Reserve decision tomorrow. But as is always the case with these high-flying assets, there's more to the story.\n\nLet's dive into some of the key drivers affecting demand for these three top cryptos today.\n\n## ETF flows generating outsized attention\n\nFollowing the post-Trump election victory, which saw Bitcoin rise to new all-time highs, and other top tokens like Ethereum and Dogecoin also see their fair share of upside, the performance of these top three cryptocurrencies has been overtly negative since Inauguration Day.\n\nSome of this depressed sentiment can be tied to spot ETF inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum. Among the notable reports I've seen come through is one detailing the surge of capital into gold-denominated ETFs and assets, with ETF outflows from various Bitcoin ETFs presumably flowing into these safe-haven funds.\n\nOne of the key investing theses held by long-term Bitcoin bulls (and to a certain extent, Ethereum holders as well) is that these digital assets carry some \"store of value\" properties that should provide demand even in the worst market environments. In fairness, we've yet to see how any cryptocurrency performs in a prolonged bear market (Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency, created in 2009 following the GFC).\n\nThat said, the fact that spot Bitcoin ETFs have given up their lead over gold ETFs (which was first gained late last year following the Trump election victory) is a trend worth noting. If more capital continues to flow out of this space, spot Ethereum ETFs (and future potential spot ETFs for Dogecoin and other assets) may have a much more negative outlook. Indeed, the recent news that two Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs are being liquidated by 21Shares adds to this narrative.\n\n## What to make of these recession concerns?\n\nI think the price action of all three major tokens today, and for the better part of the past two months, is really indicative of how investors view cryptocurrencies as an asset class in a potential recession. Right now, market participants are increasingly attempting to price new recession probabilities into their models. For top cryptos like these, their performance in a protracted downturn is really not known. That's adding to the uncertainty around owning these assets heading into what could be a turbulent back half of 2025.\n\nI think Bitcoin and Ethereum should have plenty of long-term upside. But I'm also aware that these assets have posted multiple 50%-plus drawdowns in the past, on lesser news than concerns around a potential recession. So investors will have to hone in on their investing timeline and what sort of levels they'd consider buying these assets at first before jumping in with both feet.\n\nMy view of Dogecoin is that this meme token is more of a speculative tool for traders to play sentiment to the upside and downside. Today's outsized move lower is indicative of how this token trades (with plenty of leveraged derivatives positions in the background driving these volatile moves).\n\nIf you're of the mind that more downside is likely, buying the dip with the world's two most valuable cryptocurrencies may be the strategy of choice.\n\n_[Chris MacDonald](https://www.fool.com/author/20447/) has positions in Ethereum.

Earlier in the day, however, they were up as much as 3.6%, 8.7%, and 4.7%, respectively. The **S&P 500** is up 0.8% and the **Nasdaq Composite** is up 1.1%.\n\nAll three cryptocurrencies got a boost from news that the SEC's appeal in its case against **XRP** would be dropped, a major step that confirms the Trump administration's softer approach to crypto regulation, boosting the whole market.\n\n## SEC backs off\n\n[Ripple, the company behind XRP](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/03/06/should-you-buy-xrp-while-its-under-250/), announced that the SEC is abandoning its appeal in the long-running legal battle against the company. The case dates back to 2020 when the SEC sued Ripple for allegedly selling unregistered securities. Ripple scored a partial victory last year when a judge ruled XRP wasn't a security when sold to retail investors -- though institutional sales were different. The SEC appealed this decision, but now, after a change in leadership, the regulator is dropping its appeal.\n\nThis development comes amid a sweeping reversal of the previous administration's crypto crackdown. The SEC recently ended its **Coinbase Global** case, closed investigations into several crypto companies, scaled back enforcement, and declared [meme coins](https://www.fool.com/terms/m/meme-coin/) aren't securities.

Most stablecoins exist on a parent blockchain and Ethereum dominates the space. It was reported yesterday that Ethereum's four-month average trading volume for these stablecoins reached $850 billion.

The partnership will also include a donation platform supporting a cause important to the team.\n\nThe Indianapolis 500 draws over 350,000 in-person spectators and many more around the world.

The reserve is still projecting modest GDP growth and relatively mild inflation, so fears of a recession or \"stagflation\" -- little to no GDP growth with high inflation -- were not echoed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. That's good news for now.\n\nHowever, Powell has indicated that the current environment makes predicting the future particularly difficult. There is a lot of uncertainty in the market at the moment. So, while recent developments helped boost the big three cryptocurrencies, they are still volatile assets, especially Dogecoin, a meme coin.

Earlier in the day, however, they were up as much as 3.6%, 8.7%, and 4.7%, respectively. The **S&P 500** is up 0.8% and the **Nasdaq Composite** is up 1.1%.\n\nAll three cryptocurrencies got a boost from news that the SEC's appeal in its case against **XRP** would be dropped, a major step that confirms the Trump administration's softer approach to crypto regulation, boosting the whole market.\n\n## SEC backs off\n\n[Ripple, the company behind XRP](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/03/06/should-you-buy-xrp-while-its-under-250/), announced that the SEC is abandoning its appeal in the long-running legal battle against the company. The case dates back to 2020 when the SEC sued Ripple for allegedly selling unregistered securities. Ripple scored a partial victory last year when a judge ruled XRP wasn't a security when sold to retail investors -- though institutional sales were different. The SEC appealed this decision, but now, after a change in leadership, the regulator is dropping its appeal.\n\nThis development comes amid a sweeping reversal of the previous administration's crypto crackdown. The SEC recently ended its **Coinbase Global** case, closed investigations into several crypto companies, scaled back enforcement, and declared [meme coins](https://www.fool.com/terms/m/meme-coin/) aren't securities. It's clear that the Trump administration's SEC will not take a hard line in regulating the nascent industry; investors reacted positively.\n\nArrows-InCollapse\n\n![](https://g.foolcdn.com/art/companylogos/mark/BTC.png)\n\n## [CRYPTO: BTC](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/btc/)\n\nBitcoin\n\nToday's Change\n\n(-2.68%) -$2,343.64\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$85,153.00\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nYTD1w1m3m6m\n1y\n\n\n+23.36%\n\n\n5y\n\nPrice\n\nVS S&P\n\n\nBTC\n\n\n### Key Data Points\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$1.7T\n\nDay's Range\n\n$85,045.00 - $87,724.00\n\n52wk Range\n\n$49,221.15 - $108,785.53\n\nVolume\n\n26,862,131,525\n\nAvg Vol\n\nGross Margin\n\n0.00%\n\nDividend Yield\n\nN/A\n\n## Ethereum's Stablecoin dominance continues\n\nThe crypto market has seen some turbulence in the last few months. However, stablecoins like **USDC** have seen remarkable inflows of capital. The coins, which are fixed in value, are growing in popularity as a sort of digital cash. Most stablecoins exist on a parent blockchain and Ethereum dominates the space. It was reported yesterday that Ethereum's four-month average trading volume for these stablecoins reached $850 billion. The continued dominance shows Ethereum is still holding its lead as the preferred \"smart contract\" blockchain as others have proliferated.\n\nArrows-OutExpand\n\n![](https://g.foolcdn.com/art/companylogos/mark/ETH.png)\n\n## [CRYPTO: ETH](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/eth/)\n\nEthereum\n\nToday's Change\n\n(-5.89%) -$119.37\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$1,907.27\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nYTD1w1m3m6m\n1y\n\n\n -43.73%\n\n\n5y\n\nPrice\n\nVS S&P\n\n\nETH\n\n\n### Key Data Points\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$230B\n\nDay's Range\n\n$1,907.02 - $2,034.03\n\n52wk Range\n\n$1,791.23 - $4,089.23\n\nVolume\n\n16,855,101,120\n\nAvg Vol\n\nGross Margin\n\n0.00%\n\nDividend Yield\n\nN/A\n\n## Dogecoin's new sponsorship\n\nThe House of Doge and Dogecoin Foundation, organizations that support and promote the cryptocurrency and meme coin, announced a new partnership today. The two are teaming up with IndyCar driver Devlin DeFrancesco and Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing to bring Dogecoin to the 109th running of the Indianapolis 500.\n\nThe Dogecoin Racing initiative will let fans vote on DeFrancesco's car design for the May 25 race, so long as the iconic Shiba Inu dog is at the center of the design. The partnership will also include a donation platform supporting a cause important to the team.\n\nThe Indianapolis 500 draws over 350,000 in-person spectators and many more around the world. Investors see this as an opportunity to boost Dogecoin's profile.\n\nArrows-OutExpand\n\n![](https://g.foolcdn.com/art/companylogos/mark/DOGE.png)\n\n## [CRYPTO: DOGE](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/doge/)\n\nDogecoin\n\nToday's Change\n\n(-7.29%) -$0.01\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$0.18\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nYTD1w\n1m\n\n\n -7.76%\n\n\n3m6m1y5y\n\nPrice\n\nVS S&P\n\n\nDOGE\n\n\n### Key Data Points\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$27B\n\nDay's Range\n\n$0.18 - $0.20\n\n52wk Range\n\n$0.08 - $0.48\n\nVolume\n\n1,463,255,883\n\nAvg Vol\n\nGross Margin\n\n0.00%\n\nDividend Yield\n\nN/A\n\n## Macro trends don't look great\n\nThe Federal Reserve announced today that there were no changes to the current interest rate plan. The reserve is still projecting modest GDP growth and relatively mild inflation, so fears of a recession or \"stagflation\" -- little to no GDP growth with high inflation -- were not echoed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. That's good news for now.\n\nHowever, Powell has indicated that the current environment makes predicting the future particularly difficult. There is a lot of uncertainty in the market at the moment. So, while recent developments helped boost the big three cryptocurrencies, they are still volatile assets, especially Dogecoin, a meme coin. They are highly sensitive to broader economic conditions and rising uncertainty. A looser regulatory environment could be offset by the uncertainty Trump's trade tariffs and foreign policy bring.\n\n_[Johnny Rice](https://www.fool.com/author/20621/) has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

decision at 2 PM ET. Unlike previous bear markets, traders are seeing shorter bear cycles followed by sharp price rallies.\n\nThe upcoming FOMC meeting could usher higher volatility in the prices of top three cryptocurrencies and present buy the dip opportunities or offer opportunities for traders to take profits, amidst the prolonged bear market.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n## Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP trader sentiment turn risk-off\n\nBitcoin ![Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/images/icons/bitcoin.svg)btc-2.7% [Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/price/bitcoin/), Ethereum ![Ethereum](https://crypto.news/images/icons/ethereum.svg)eth-5.87% [Ethereum](https://crypto.news/price/ethereum/) and XRP ![XRP](https://crypto.news/images/icons/ripple.svg)xrp-6.03% [XRP](https://crypto.news/price/xrp/) traders have reduced their activity in the derivatives market in the past 24 hours. Derivatives data from Coinglass shows a decline in trade volume, BTC and ETH trade volume declined nearly 11% and 7%. XRP noted a nearly 14% decline in trade volume in the same timeframe.\n\nCoinglass shows that traders have turned risk-averse following nearly $89 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours in the top three cryptocurrencies.\n\n![Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP](https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-19-at-3.25.51%E2%80%AFPM.png)Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP derivatives data \\| Source: [Coinglass](https://www.coinglass.com/)\n\nOpen Interest, another key derivatives metric, the combined value of all open contracts in a given token climbed by 1.42%, 4.90% and 1.49% respectively for the top three cryptos BTC, ETH and XRP.\n\n## BTC, ETH, XRP on-chain analysis\n\nOn-chain analysis for the top three cryptocurrencies on Santiment shows that Binance funding rate for Bitcoin has been positive for three consecutive days in a row. Meaning Bitcoin derivatives traders expect price to appreciate, even as they reduce their activity in the token, as gathered by Coinglass data.\n\nEthereum supply held by whales, excluding exchanges, sees no significant change, while Bitcoin supply held by funds has reduced consistently. The active addresses in XRP, on the daily timeframe have climbed on Wednesday, after a negative spike on Tuesday, as noted by Santiment.\n\nThe mixed on-chain data suggests a slightly bullish outlook for Bitcoin and XRP and Ethereum price could remain stable or unchanged in the face of upcoming volatility in the prices of the top three cryptocurrencies with the looming FOMC interest rate decision.\n\n![Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP](https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2025/03/Bitcoin-BTC-15.35.01-19-Mar-2025.png)Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP on-chain analysis \\| Source: [Santiment](https://app.santiment.net/charts/cdySJuvR__sCl)\n\nOn the Bitcoin blockchain, the ratio of daily on-chain transactions in profits is nearly double that of transactions in losses, there is scope for profit-taking by traders who bought the token lower. In the case of Ethereum, there is a slight uptick in the supply in profit and the same has been observed in XRP.\n\nEthereum and XRP both offer limited profit-taking opportunities for traders, as seen in the chart below.\n\n![Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP](https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2025/03/Bitcoin-BTC-15.38.03-19-Mar-2025.png)Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP on-chain analysis \\| Source: [Santiment](https://app.santiment.net/charts/cdySJuvR__sCl)\n\nYou might also like:\n[Why did South Korea reject a Bitcoin reserve? How do other countries explain the reluctance to adopt the BTC reserve?](https://crypto.news/why-did-south-korea-reject-a-bitcoin-reserve/)\n\n## Trump push and FOMC rate decision\n\nBitget CEO Gracy Chen told Crypto.news that Trump’s pro-crypto stance has left many traders puzzled. The idea of a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve is gaining traction and while the government is not buying Bitcoin yet, it could soon change.\n\n> “The Stablecoin bill is moving through Congress, signaling a major shift toward a blockchain-based financial system. Some big names, Elon Musk included, are exploring their own stablecoins, and Trump’s team sees stablecoins as a way to protect the dollar’s global reserve status.\n>\n> Then there’s the economy. Scott Bessent’s talk of a “detox period” suggests a controlled downturn might be ahead. If that’s the case, Trump’s playbook seems clear: blame the recession on Biden, use tariffs and crypto narratives to manage costs, and push for lower interest rates to fuel tech and AI growth. Short-term pain, long-term gain — that’s the strategy.”\n\nChen maintains an optimistic outlook on Bitcoin and predicts no fall under $70,000.\n\n> “Bitcoin price drop to possibly 73-78k \\[is likely\\], which is a solid time to enter for any buyers on the fence. In the next 1-2 years, BTC at 200k isn’t as far-fetched as most would think.”\n\nThe FOMC interest rate decision is looming, with the likelihood of higher volatility and price swings as traders react to the news.\n\nRyan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research told Crypto.news in a written note:\n\n> “The FOMC meeting on March 19, 2025, is expected to maintain the federal funds rate at 4.25%-4.50%, with the Fed taking a cautious, data-driven approach amid persistent inflation and solid economic growth.\n>\n> Crypto markets could see a short-term rally if the Fed signals future rate cuts, boosting risk appetite, or a dip if a hawkish stance reinforces tighter financial conditions. However, Bitcoin’s growing resilience and pro-crypto policy tailwinds might temper the broader market impact.”\n\nLee believes that volatility is likely around the announcement, it could be driven by Federal Reserve chair Powell’s remarks and updated rate projections.\n\n> “The crypto market may continue showing increasing independence from Fed decisions. Post-FOMC, Bitcoin is expected to trade within $80,000–$86,000 with 80% confidence, while Ethereum is projected to move between $1,800–$2,100 under the same confidence level. These ranges reflect potential fluctuations tied to macroeconomic signals, investor sentiment, and broader financial conditions.”\n\nYou might also like:\n[Nansen: Whales quietly buy Ethereum as prices stagnate](https://crypto.news/nansen-whales-quietly-buy-ethereum-as-prices-stagnate/)\n\n## Bitcoin eyes return to $87,000, Ethereum could climb to $2,100\n\nBitcoin could return to the $87,000 level as BTC shows signs of recovery on Wednesday.

decision at 2 PM ET. Unlike previous bear markets, traders are seeing shorter bear cycles followed by sharp price rallies.\n\nThe upcoming FOMC meeting could usher higher volatility in the prices of top three cryptocurrencies and present buy the dip opportunities or offer opportunities for traders to take profits, amidst the prolonged bear market.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n## Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP trader sentiment turn risk-off\n\nBitcoin ![Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/images/icons/bitcoin.svg)btc-2.7% [Bitcoin](https://crypto.news/price/bitcoin/), Ethereum ![Ethereum](https://crypto.news/images/icons/ethereum.svg)eth-5.87% [Ethereum](https://crypto.news/price/ethereum/) and XRP ![XRP](https://crypto.news/images/icons/ripple.svg)xrp-6.03% [XRP](https://crypto.news/price/xrp/) traders have reduced their activity in the derivatives market in the past 24 hours. Derivatives data from Coinglass shows a decline in trade volume, BTC and ETH trade volume declined nearly 11% and 7%. XRP noted a nearly 14% decline in trade volume in the same timeframe.\n\nCoinglass shows that traders have turned risk-averse following nearly $89 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours in the top three cryptocurrencies.\n\n![Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP](https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-19-at-3.25.51%E2%80%AFPM.png)Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP derivatives data \\| Source: [Coinglass](https://www.coinglass.com/)\n\nOpen Interest, another key derivatives metric, the combined value of all open contracts in a given token climbed by 1.42%, 4.90% and 1.49% respectively for the top three cryptos BTC, ETH and XRP.\n\n## BTC, ETH, XRP on-chain analysis\n\nOn-chain analysis for the top three cryptocurrencies on Santiment shows that Binance funding rate for Bitcoin has been positive for three consecutive days in a row. Meaning Bitcoin derivatives traders expect price to appreciate, even as they reduce their activity in the token, as gathered by Coinglass data.\n\nEthereum supply held by whales, excluding exchanges, sees no significant change, while Bitcoin supply held by funds has reduced consistently. The active addresses in XRP, on the daily timeframe have climbed on Wednesday, after a negative spike on Tuesday, as noted by Santiment.\n\nThe mixed on-chain data suggests a slightly bullish outlook for Bitcoin and XRP and Ethereum price could remain stable or unchanged in the face of upcoming volatility in the prices of the top three cryptocurrencies with the looming FOMC interest rate decision.\n\n![Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP](https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2025/03/Bitcoin-BTC-15.35.01-19-Mar-2025.png)Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP on-chain analysis \\| Source: [Santiment](https://app.santiment.net/charts/cdySJuvR__sCl)\n\nOn the Bitcoin blockchain, the ratio of daily on-chain transactions in profits is nearly double that of transactions in losses, there is scope for profit-taking by traders who bought the token lower. In the case of Ethereum, there is a slight uptick in the supply in profit and the same has been observed in XRP.\n\nEthereum and XRP both offer limited profit-taking opportunities for traders, as seen in the chart below.\n\n![Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP](https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2025/03/Bitcoin-BTC-15.38.03-19-Mar-2025.png)Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP on-chain analysis \\| Source: [Santiment](https://app.santiment.net/charts/cdySJuvR__sCl)\n\nYou might also like:\n[Why did South Korea reject a Bitcoin reserve? How do other countries explain the reluctance to adopt the BTC reserve?](https://crypto.news/why-did-south-korea-reject-a-bitcoin-reserve/)\n\n## Trump push and FOMC rate decision\n\nBitget CEO Gracy Chen told Crypto.news that Trump’s pro-crypto stance has left many traders puzzled. The idea of a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve is gaining traction and while the government is not buying Bitcoin yet, it could soon change.\n\n> “The Stablecoin bill is moving through Congress, signaling a major shift toward a blockchain-based financial system. Some big names, Elon Musk included, are exploring their own stablecoins, and Trump’s team sees stablecoins as a way to protect the dollar’s global reserve status.\n>\n> Then there’s the economy. Scott Bessent’s talk of a “detox period” suggests a controlled downturn might be ahead. If that’s the case, Trump’s playbook seems clear: blame the recession on Biden, use tariffs and crypto narratives to manage costs, and push for lower interest rates to fuel tech and AI growth. Short-term pain, long-term gain — that’s the strategy.”\n\nChen maintains an optimistic outlook on Bitcoin and predicts no fall under $70,000.\n\n> “Bitcoin price drop to possibly 73-78k \\[is likely\\], which is a solid time to enter for any buyers on the fence. In the next 1-2 years, BTC at 200k isn’t as far-fetched as most would think.”\n\nThe FOMC interest rate decision is looming, with the likelihood of higher volatility and price swings as traders react to the news.\n\nRyan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research told Crypto.news in a written note:\n\n> “The FOMC meeting on March 19, 2025, is expected to maintain the federal funds rate at 4.25%-4.50%, with the Fed taking a cautious, data-driven approach amid persistent inflation and solid economic growth.\n>\n> Crypto markets could see a short-term rally if the Fed signals future rate cuts, boosting risk appetite, or a dip if a hawkish stance reinforces tighter financial conditions. However, Bitcoin’s growing resilience and pro-crypto policy tailwinds might temper the broader market impact.”\n\nLee believes that volatility is likely around the announcement, it could be driven by Federal Reserve chair Powell’s remarks and updated rate projections.\n\n> “The crypto market may continue showing increasing independence from Fed decisions. Post-FOMC, Bitcoin is expected to trade within $80,000–$86,000 with 80% confidence, while Ethereum is projected to move between $1,800–$2,100 under the same confidence level. These ranges reflect potential fluctuations tied to macroeconomic signals, investor sentiment, and broader financial conditions.”\n\nYou might also like:\n[Nansen: Whales quietly buy Ethereum as prices stagnate](https://crypto.news/nansen-whales-quietly-buy-ethereum-as-prices-stagnate/)\n\n## Bitcoin eyes return to $87,000, Ethereum could climb to $2,100\n\nBitcoin could return to the $87,000 level as BTC shows signs of recovery on Wednesday. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $83,517, and technical indicators on the daily timeframe show likelihood of gains in the token.\n\nBitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) reads 44 and is sloping upwards, supporting a thesis of positive momentum underlying the token’s price trend.

The active addresses in XRP, on the daily timeframe have climbed on Wednesday, after a negative spike on Tuesday, as noted by Santiment.\n\nThe mixed on-chain data suggests a slightly bullish outlook for Bitcoin and XRP and Ethereum price could remain stable or unchanged in the face of upcoming volatility in the prices of the top three cryptocurrencies with the looming FOMC interest rate decision.\n\n![Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP](https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2025/03/Bitcoin-BTC-15.35.01-19-Mar-2025.png)Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP on-chain analysis \\| Source: [Santiment](https://app.santiment.net/charts/cdySJuvR__sCl)\n\nOn the Bitcoin blockchain, the ratio of daily on-chain transactions in profits is nearly double that of transactions in losses, there is scope for profit-taking by traders who bought the token lower.

How do other countries explain the reluctance to adopt the BTC reserve?](https://crypto.news/why-did-south-korea-reject-a-bitcoin-reserve/)\n\n## Trump push and FOMC rate decision\n\nBitget CEO Gracy Chen told Crypto.news that Trump’s pro-crypto stance has left many traders puzzled. The idea of a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve is gaining traction and while the government is not buying Bitcoin yet, it could soon change.\n\n> “The Stablecoin bill is moving through Congress, signaling a major shift toward a blockchain-based financial system. Some big names, Elon Musk included, are exploring their own stablecoins, and Trump’s team sees stablecoins as a way to protect the dollar’s global reserve status.\n>\n> Then there’s the economy. Scott Bessent’s talk of a “detox period” suggests a controlled downturn might be ahead. If that’s the case, Trump’s playbook seems clear: blame the recession on Biden, use tariffs and crypto narratives to manage costs, and push for lower interest rates to fuel tech and AI growth. Short-term pain, long-term gain — that’s the strategy.”\n\nChen maintains an optimistic outlook on Bitcoin and predicts no fall under $70,000.\n\n> “Bitcoin price drop to possibly 73-78k \\[is likely\\], which is a solid time to enter for any buyers on the fence. In the next 1-2 years, BTC at 200k isn’t as far-fetched as most would think.”\n\nThe FOMC interest rate decision is looming, with the likelihood of higher volatility and price swings as traders react to the news.\n\nRyan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research told Crypto.news in a written note:\n\n> “The FOMC meeting on March 19, 2025, is expected to maintain the federal funds rate at 4.25%-4.50%, with the Fed taking a cautious, data-driven approach amid persistent inflation and solid economic growth.\n>\n> Crypto markets could see a short-term rally if the Fed signals future rate cuts, boosting risk appetite, or a dip if a hawkish stance reinforces tighter financial conditions. However, Bitcoin’s growing resilience and pro-crypto policy tailwinds might temper the broader market impact.”\n\nLee believes that volatility is likely around the announcement, it could be driven by Federal Reserve chair Powell’s remarks and updated rate projections.\n\n> “The crypto market may continue showing increasing independence from Fed decisions. Post-FOMC, Bitcoin is expected to trade within $80,000–$86,000 with 80% confidence, while Ethereum is projected to move between $1,800–$2,100 under the same confidence level. These ranges reflect potential fluctuations tied to macroeconomic signals, investor sentiment, and broader financial conditions.”\n\nYou might also like:\n[Nansen: Whales quietly buy Ethereum as prices stagnate](https://crypto.news/nansen-whales-quietly-buy-ethereum-as-prices-stagnate/)\n\n## Bitcoin eyes return to $87,000, Ethereum could climb to $2,100\n\nBitcoin could return to the $87,000 level as BTC shows signs of recovery on Wednesday.

It might not push the prices of these coins up indefinitely, but it's already having an effect.\n\nArrows-InCollapse\n\n## [CRYPTO: BTC](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/btc/)\n\nBitcoin\n\nToday's Change\n\n(-2.68%) -$2,343.64\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$85,153.00\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nYTD1w1m3m6m1y\n5y\n\n\nPrice\n\nVS S&P\n\n\n### Key Data Points\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$1.7T\n\nDay's Range\n\n$85,045.00 - $87,724.00\n\n52wk Range\n\n$49,221.15 - $108,785.53\n\nVolume\n\n26,862,131,525\n\nAvg Vol\n\nGross Margin\n\n0.00%\n\nDividend Yield\n\nN/A\n\n## Geopolitics are now undeniably a big part of crypto markets\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are assets with a global distribution. That means that in most major economies, people and businesses buy, hold, and sell them, even if it isn't fully legal to do so. In many major countries, cryptocurrency exchanges are operating legally as well. But even fully legal exchanges within well-defined regulatory regimes can be used for illegal or otherwise less-than-wholesome purposes, like dodging international sanctions or [money laundering](https://www.fool.com/terms/m/money-laundering/).\n\nRussia extracts, refines, and sells a lot of oil. In terms of dollars, Russia's oil trade was worth $192 billion in 2024; the country's native currency is the ruble. Much of that trade is oil sales to India, which uses the rupee as its currency, and China, which uses the yuan. But due to international sanctions on Russia stemming from its war against Ukraine, selling oil in exchange for rupees or yuan directly is not as easy as it used to be, as it'd entail violating sanctions.\n\nSo now, per Reuters reporting in mid-March, Russian oil businesses are using Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies to facilitate their payments and evade the barriers to trade posed by the sanctions.\n\nTo illustrate how this process works, let's say that a company in India wants to buy oil from Russia. First, the company pays a sketchy middleman, typically a shell company, in rupees. Then, that middleman exchanges the rupees for Bitcoin, Ethereum, or a [stablecoin](https://www.fool.com/terms/s/stablecoins/). This is an action that is not in and of itself in violation of any sanctions, so it isn't inhibited in any way at the point of the exchange. Next, the cryptocurrency is sent to the Russian business selling oil. That business then sells its crypto to convert it into rubles.\n\nThe payment is cleared, and the oil is transferred accordingly, effectively skirting the sanctions. One Russian crypto exchange faced sanctions from the U.S. and European Union for facilitating this type of workaround in 2022. This ultimately led to it shutting down in early March of this year after some of its stablecoin [wallet addresses](https://www.fool.com/terms/b/blockchain-wallet/) were blocked by the coin's issuer. However, it's very likely that other exchanges are still in operation, and that more can spring up to take the fallen one's place.\n\nTherefore, investors should calculate that the sanctions evasion trade is more likely to continue using Bitcoin and Ethereum than it is with stablecoins moving forward. This will create buying pressure for those two coins for as long as the sanctions last, and perhaps even beyond that.\n\nThe force of that pressure may be substantial, depending on future demand for Russian oil.\n\nArrows-InCollapse\n\n## [CRYPTO: ETH](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/eth/)\n\nEthereum\n\nToday's Change\n\n(-5.89%) -$119.37\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$1,907.27\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nYTD1w1m3m6m1y\n5y\n\n\nPrice\n\nVS S&P\n\n\n### Key Data Points\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$230B\n\nDay's Range\n\n$1,907.02 - $2,034.03\n\n52wk Range\n\n$1,791.23 - $4,089.23\n\nVolume\n\n16,855,101,120\n\nAvg Vol\n\nGross Margin\n\n0.00%\n\nDividend Yield\n\nN/A\n\n## This could unravel explosively\n\nCryptocurrency's legal status in Russia is shifting in real time. Its central bank just implemented a three-year pilot program enabling wealthy investors to trade cryptos and derivative financial instruments. The ongoing process is bound to have implications for how the country's domestic businesses can use Bitcoin and Ethereum to avoid sanctions.\n\nThus, most investors shouldn't commit to buying significant quantities of Bitcoin and Ethereum based solely on the evasion trade. It's unclear how long Russia will be facing sanctions, so the buying pressure represented by its oil companies may taper off suddenly, causing prices to fall or be more volatile than usual. It's also unclear if there will be attempts at enforcing the sanctions, given the nature of the particular cryptos used.\n\nBut, like it or not, this saga supports one of the key pillars of Bitcoin's value, which is that it's a form of money that's not subject to the oversight of any one country in the way that [fiat currencies](https://www.fool.com/terms/f/fiat-currency/) are. If it were like fiat currencies and not independent of governments, there'd be a large probability of a central issuing authority blocking the wallet addresses of known sanctions evaders.

That means that in most major economies, people and businesses buy, hold, and sell them, even if it isn't fully legal to do so. In many major countries, cryptocurrency exchanges are operating legally as well. But even fully legal exchanges within well-defined regulatory regimes can be used for illegal or otherwise less-than-wholesome purposes, like dodging international sanctions or [money laundering](https://www.fool.com/terms/m/money-laundering/).\n\nRussia extracts, refines, and sells a lot of oil. In terms of dollars, Russia's oil trade was worth $192 billion in 2024; the country's native currency is the ruble. Much of that trade is oil sales to India, which uses the rupee as its currency, and China, which uses the yuan. But due to international sanctions on Russia stemming from its war against Ukraine, selling oil in exchange for rupees or yuan directly is not as easy as it used to be, as it'd entail violating sanctions.\n\nSo now, per Reuters reporting in mid-March, Russian oil businesses are using Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies to facilitate their payments and evade the barriers to trade posed by the sanctions.\n\nTo illustrate how this process works, let's say that a company in India wants to buy oil from Russia. First, the company pays a sketchy middleman, typically a shell company, in rupees. Then, that middleman exchanges the rupees for Bitcoin, Ethereum, or a [stablecoin](https://www.fool.com/terms/s/stablecoins/). This is an action that is not in and of itself in violation of any sanctions, so it isn't inhibited in any way at the point of the exchange. Next, the cryptocurrency is sent to the Russian business selling oil. That business then sells its crypto to convert it into rubles.\n\nThe payment is cleared, and the oil is transferred accordingly, effectively skirting the sanctions. One Russian crypto exchange faced sanctions from the U.S. and European Union for facilitating this type of workaround in 2022. This ultimately led to it shutting down in early March of this year after some of its stablecoin [wallet addresses](https://www.fool.com/terms/b/blockchain-wallet/) were blocked by the coin's issuer. However, it's very likely that other exchanges are still in operation, and that more can spring up to take the fallen one's place.\n\nTherefore, investors should calculate that the sanctions evasion trade is more likely to continue using Bitcoin and Ethereum than it is with stablecoins moving forward. This will create buying pressure for those two coins for as long as the sanctions last, and perhaps even beyond that.\n\nThe force of that pressure may be substantial, depending on future demand for Russian oil.\n\nArrows-InCollapse\n\n## [CRYPTO: ETH](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/eth/)\n\nEthereum\n\nToday's Change\n\n(-5.89%) -$119.37\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$1,907.27\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nYTD1w1m3m6m1y\n5y\n\n\nPrice\n\nVS S&P\n\n\n### Key Data Points\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$230B\n\nDay's Range\n\n$1,907.02 - $2,034.03\n\n52wk Range\n\n$1,791.23 - $4,089.23\n\nVolume\n\n16,855,101,120\n\nAvg Vol\n\nGross Margin\n\n0.00%\n\nDividend Yield\n\nN/A\n\n## This could unravel explosively\n\nCryptocurrency's legal status in Russia is shifting in real time. Its central bank just implemented a three-year pilot program enabling wealthy investors to trade cryptos and derivative financial instruments. The ongoing process is bound to have implications for how the country's domestic businesses can use Bitcoin and Ethereum to avoid sanctions.\n\nThus, most investors shouldn't commit to buying significant quantities of Bitcoin and Ethereum based solely on the evasion trade. It's unclear how long Russia will be facing sanctions, so the buying pressure represented by its oil companies may taper off suddenly, causing prices to fall or be more volatile than usual. It's also unclear if there will be attempts at enforcing the sanctions, given the nature of the particular cryptos used.\n\nBut, like it or not, this saga supports one of the key pillars of Bitcoin's value, which is that it's a form of money that's not subject to the oversight of any one country in the way that [fiat currencies](https://www.fool.com/terms/f/fiat-currency/) are. If it were like fiat currencies and not independent of governments, there'd be a large probability of a central issuing authority blocking the wallet addresses of known sanctions evaders.

Strategy, one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, acquired another 130 BTC last week, according to an announcement on Monday.\n\nEthereum (ETH) gained 1.54%, and XRP added 2.40% to its value today.\n\n## Bitcoin ready to cover lost ground, eyes return above $90,000\n\nBitcoin trades at $83,000 at the time of writing. Technical indicators on the BTC/USDT daily price chart support a thesis of gains in the largest cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) reads 42 and is sloping upward. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator flashes green histogram bars above the neutral line. The Bitcoin price trend has an underlying positive momentum on the daily timeframe.\n\nThe two key momentum indicators support Bitcoin’s gains, and a return to resistance at the $90,000 level is likely.\n\nBTC price is currently 8.35% away from the $90,000 resistance. The $90,000 level is key to Bitcoin price since the token has been hovering under this level since March 7, as observed in the BTC/USDT chart below:\n\n[![BTC/USDT](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/BTCUSDT_2025-03-17_18-32-22-638778183039557556.png)](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/BTCUSDT_2025-03-17_18-32-22-638778183039557556.png)\n\nBTC/USDT daily price chart\n\n## Ethereum could test psychologically important $2,000 level\n\nEthereum trades at $1,902 at the time of writing.

A successful daily [candlestick](https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart/candlestick-patterns) close above the $2,000 mark could push the altcoin toward resistance at the lower boundary of the Fair Value Gap (FVG) at $2,533.\n\nThe rally to $2,533 would mark an over 30% gain from the current ETH price.\n\nTwo key momentum indicators, the RSI and MACD, support Ether’s recent gains. The RSI is sloping upward and reads 34, while the MACD shows an underlying positive momentum in Ethereum price trend.\n\n[![ETH/USDT](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/ETHUSDT_2025-03-17_19-04-33-638778183479525997.png)](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/ETHUSDT_2025-03-17_19-04-33-638778183479525997.png)\n\nETH/USDT daily price chart\n\nA failure to test the $2,000 level could imply weakness in Ether’s price trend and the nearly 16-month low at $1,754 could come into play as support.\n\n## XRP could rally 10%, shows signs of recovery\n\nXRP trades at $2.3386 at the time of writing on Monday. The [altcoin](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/sec-pumps-breaks-on-altcoin-etfs-institutional-interest-remains-202503150730) gained nearly 2% on the day, and the momentum indicators on the daily price chart support gains in XRP.\n\nThe 50% [Fibonacci](https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci) retracement of XRP’s decline from the peak of $3.40 to the February low of $1.7711 — at $2.5856 — is a key resistance for the altcoin. A rally to this level could mark 10% gains in XRP.\n\nThe RSI reads 48 and is sloping upward, while the MACD flashes green histogram bars above the neutral line.\n\n[![XRP](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/XRPUSDT_2025-03-17_19-15-20-638778184138187957.png)](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/XRPUSDT_2025-03-17_19-15-20-638778184138187957.png)\n\nXRP/USDT daily price chart\n\nIn the event of a flash crash in Bitcoin, altcoins like XRP and Ether could face a correction. XRP could find support at the multi-month low of $1.7711 if there is a serious decline in the altcoin’s price.\n\n## Expert commentary on where Bitcoin and Ethereum are headed\n\nRyan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, told [FXStreet](https://www.fxstreet.com/) that the recent Bitcoin pullback put the spotlight on the $82,000 and $85,000 support levels.\n\n> Lee said, “It’s a classic post-rally consolidation phase that is healthy but also a test of whether Bitcoin’s recent momentum has real staying power. Institutional buying and the buzz around a potential US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve continue to prop up sentiment, but with resistance looming near $85,000–$90,000, a breakout won’t come easy.\n>\n> Let’s not forget the macro wildcard: any unexpected FOMC moves could throw a wrench into the market. If sentiment turns bearish, we could see Bitcoin dip toward $75,000–$80,000, though a bullish macro backdrop could send it climbing back to $90,000.”\n\nObserving that [Ethereum](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/ethereum) and Bitcoin are tightly correlated and the altcoin tends to respond to shifts in the BTC price trend, Lee told FXStreet:\n\n> “The ETH/BTC ratio’s weakness suggests Ethereum is struggling to find independent strength, even with promising developments on the horizon. The Pectra upgrade and ongoing Layer 2 expansion give it a bullish long-term case, but in the short term, those fundamentals might not be enough to break resistance at $2,300–$2,500 without Bitcoin leading the charge. If market sentiment sours, ETH could slip to $1,800, but Ethereum could push toward the top of its range if BTC stages a recovery. Right now, it’s a waiting game—does Bitcoin hold the line, or does the market need a deeper reset before the next leg up?”\n\n* * *\n\nShare: [Cryptos feed](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/feed)\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Strategy, one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, acquired another 130 BTC last week, according to an announcement on Monday.\n\nEthereum (ETH) gained 1.54%, and XRP added 2.40% to its value today.\n\n## Bitcoin ready to cover lost ground, eyes return above $90,000\n\nBitcoin trades at $83,000 at the time of writing. Technical indicators on the BTC/USDT daily price chart support a thesis of gains in the largest cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) reads 42 and is sloping upward. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator flashes green histogram bars above the neutral line. The Bitcoin price trend has an underlying positive momentum on the daily timeframe.\n\nThe two key momentum indicators support Bitcoin’s gains, and a return to resistance at the $90,000 level is likely.\n\nBTC price is currently 8.35% away from the $90,000 resistance. The $90,000 level is key to Bitcoin price since the token has been hovering under this level since March 7, as observed in the BTC/USDT chart below:\n\n[![BTC/USDT](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/BTCUSDT_2025-03-17_18-32-22-638778183039557556.png)](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/BTCUSDT_2025-03-17_18-32-22-638778183039557556.png)\n\nBTC/USDT daily price chart\n\n## Ethereum could test psychologically important $2,000 level\n\nEthereum trades at $1,902 at the time of writing.

A successful daily [candlestick](https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart/candlestick-patterns) close above the $2,000 mark could push the altcoin toward resistance at the lower boundary of the Fair Value Gap (FVG) at $2,533.\n\nThe rally to $2,533 would mark an over 30% gain from the current ETH price.\n\nTwo key momentum indicators, the RSI and MACD, support Ether’s recent gains. The RSI is sloping upward and reads 34, while the MACD shows an underlying positive momentum in Ethereum price trend.\n\n[![ETH/USDT](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/ETHUSDT_2025-03-17_19-04-33-638778183479525997.png)](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/ETHUSDT_2025-03-17_19-04-33-638778183479525997.png)\n\nETH/USDT daily price chart\n\nA failure to test the $2,000 level could imply weakness in Ether’s price trend and the nearly 16-month low at $1,754 could come into play as support.\n\n## XRP could rally 10%, shows signs of recovery\n\nXRP trades at $2.3386 at the time of writing on Monday. The [altcoin](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/sec-pumps-breaks-on-altcoin-etfs-institutional-interest-remains-202503150730) gained nearly 2% on the day, and the momentum indicators on the daily price chart support gains in XRP.\n\nThe 50% [Fibonacci](https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci) retracement of XRP’s decline from the peak of $3.40 to the February low of $1.7711 — at $2.5856 — is a key resistance for the altcoin. A rally to this level could mark 10% gains in XRP.\n\nThe RSI reads 48 and is sloping upward, while the MACD flashes green histogram bars above the neutral line.\n\n[![XRP](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/XRPUSDT_2025-03-17_19-15-20-638778184138187957.png)](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/XRPUSDT_2025-03-17_19-15-20-638778184138187957.png)\n\nXRP/USDT daily price chart\n\nIn the event of a flash crash in Bitcoin, altcoins like XRP and Ether could face a correction. XRP could find support at the multi-month low of $1.7711 if there is a serious decline in the altcoin’s price.\n\n## Expert commentary on where Bitcoin and Ethereum are headed\n\nRyan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, told [FXStreet](https://www.fxstreet.com/) that the recent Bitcoin pullback put the spotlight on the $82,000 and $85,000 support levels.\n\n> Lee said, “It’s a classic post-rally consolidation phase that is healthy but also a test of whether Bitcoin’s recent momentum has real staying power. Institutional buying and the buzz around a potential US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve continue to prop up sentiment, but with resistance looming near $85,000–$90,000, a breakout won’t come easy.\n>\n> Let’s not forget the macro wildcard: any unexpected FOMC moves could throw a wrench into the market. If sentiment turns bearish, we could see Bitcoin dip toward $75,000–$80,000, though a bullish macro backdrop could send it climbing back to $90,000.”\n\nObserving that [Ethereum](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/ethereum) and Bitcoin are tightly correlated and the altcoin tends to respond to shifts in the BTC price trend, Lee told FXStreet:\n\n> “The ETH/BTC ratio’s weakness suggests Ethereum is struggling to find independent strength, even with promising developments on the horizon. The Pectra upgrade and ongoing Layer 2 expansion give it a bullish long-term case, but in the short term, those fundamentals might not be enough to break resistance at $2,300–$2,500 without Bitcoin leading the charge. If market sentiment sours, ETH could slip to $1,800, but Ethereum could push toward the top of its range if BTC stages a recovery. Right now, it’s a waiting game—does Bitcoin hold the line, or does the market need a deeper reset before the next leg up?”\n\n* * *\n\nShare: [Cryptos feed](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/feed)\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational [differences that investors should know](https://www.etftrends.com/crypto-channel/bitcoin-ether-differences-etf-investors-should-know/). We've also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency), a cryptocurrency is \"a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.\"\n\n_For a better understanding of crypto market cycles, read more [here](https://www.etftrends.com/crypto-channel/understanding-crypto-market-cycles/)._\n\n## **Bitcoin**\n\nBitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide to a mainstream financial asset.

While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational [differences that investors should know](https://www.etftrends.com/crypto-channel/bitcoin-ether-differences-etf-investors-should-know/). We've also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began.

It has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article.\n\nEther's closing price made its way back above $2,000 this week. ETH is now down ~38% year to date and ~57% below its all-time closing high.\n\n[![Ether daily price since 2017](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content_image/data/5a/5aaa3de92145bc25b3164c8ddc1b34d9.png)](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content_image/data/5a/5aaa3de92145bc25b3164c8ddc1b34d9.png)\n\n## **XRP**\n\nXRP, which is owned by [Ripple](https://ripple.com/xrp/), was launched in 2012 and was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market.\n\nXRP surged during the last few months of 2024 and the during the first month of 2025, however, it has pulled back in February and March. XRP is up ~6% year to date.\n\n[![XRP daily price since 2017](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content_image/data/64/640d97b277b5894f7ac33cc3e11e489c.png)](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content_image/data/64/640d97b277b5894f7ac33cc3e11e489c.png)\n\nSign me up to receive email newsletters from **VettaFi Advisor Perspectives**\n\nEmail\\*\n\n## **Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP**\n\nAn index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories.

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.\n\n1082 Views\n\nRussia has started using crypto for oil trades with China and India as it seeks to bypass Western sanctions, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-leans-cryptocurrencies-oil-trade-sources-say-2025-03-14/) on March 14, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n\nAccording to the report, some Russian oil companies have settled trades in [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/), [Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/), and stablecoins like Tether’s [USDT](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/). This strategy simplifies the conversion of Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupees into Russian Rubles, enabling smoother transactions despite financial restrictions.\n\nTypically, a Chinese buyer deposits Yuan into an offshore account controlled by an intermediary. The funds are then converted into crypto and transferred through multiple accounts before reaching a final destination in Russia, where they are exchanged for Rubles.\n\nThese transactions reportedly reach tens of millions of dollars per month.\n\nAlthough crypto adoption in Russia’s oil trade remains limited, it is [part of a broader trend](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-firms-turn-to-bitcoin-stablecoins-for-global-trade-amid-sanctions/). Over the past year, the country has [introduced new regulations](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-contemplating-permanently-legalizing-stablecoins-for-cross-border-payments/) governing [crypto mining](https://cryptoslate.com/russias-bitcoin-mining-demand-triples-amid-regulatory-shifts-and-price-rally/), taxation, and international trade.\n\n[Western sanctions imposed over Russia’s](https://cryptoslate.com/tether-freezes-27m-on-garantex-forcing-halt-of-russian-linked-exchange/) military actions in Ukraine have accelerated this shift toward digital assets. However, industry sources suggest oil firms may continue using cryptocurrencies even if sanctions are lifted due to their efficiency and transaction speed.\n\n## Digital rubles challenges\n\nWhile Russia increases its reliance on crypto for trade, its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project is facing significant hurdles.\n\nLast month, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina [announced](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-delays-digital-ruble-cbdc-launch-extends-pilot-phase-indefinitely/) an indefinite delay in the launch of the digital ruble. She attributed the setback to the need for further refinements to ensure that the currency benefits all stakeholders.\n\nHowever, a recent survey indicates that the digital ruble launch was postponed due to the inadequate IT infrastructure of banks that were expected to handle the project.\n\nThe survey of Russian banking experts revealed that 30% of financial institutions are not yet prepared to support the digital ruble. Experts explained that implementing the CBDC requires banks to upgrade their IT systems to handle increased transaction volumes.\n\nMeanwhile, 20% of banking IT specialists stated that their systems are fully equipped for the digital ruble. Another 50% said they are partially prepared but need further upgrades.\n\nAt the same time, around 14% of the respondents expressed concerns over potential information security risks associated with the currency.\n\nGiven these challenges, Russia’s national digital asset initiative could face further obstacles unless major financial institutions fully prepare for its adoption.\n\n###### Mentioned in this article\n\n[![Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2020/imgresize/timthumb.php?src=https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bitcoin-logo.jpg&w=32&h=32&q=75)Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/) [![Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2020/imgresize/timthumb.php?src=https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ethereum-logo-2022.jpg&w=32&h=32&q=75)Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/) [![Tether](https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2020/imgresize/timthumb.php?src=https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tether-logo.jpg&w=32&h=32&q=75)Tether](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/) [![Tether Limited](https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2020/imgresize/timthumb.php?src=https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Tether-EURt-logo.png&w=32&h=32&q=75)Tether Limited](https://cryptoslate.com/companies/tether/)\n\n[![XRP Turbo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201280%20453%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://link.cryptoslate.com/xrpturbo)\n\nPosted In: [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/news/bitcoin/), [China](https://cryptoslate.com/places/china/), [India](https://cryptoslate.com/places/india/), [Russia](https://cryptoslate.com/places/russia/), [Adoption](https://cryptoslate.com/adoption/), [Crypto](https://cryptoslate.com/crypto/), [Featured](https://cryptoslate.com/featured-news/)\n\nPeople were interested in these podcasts\n\n[Discover more podcasts →](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-oil-firms-using-bitcoin-and-ethereum-for-cross-border-payments-with-china/#)\n\nPlay Episode\n\n25min\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nProof-of-Work security: Mike Siers on AuthLN’s bold vision for cyber defense\n\nIn a recent SlateCast episode, CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief, Liam “Akiba” Wright, spoke with AuthLN Founder Mike Siers about leveraging Bitcoin’s Lightning Network to address the massive problem of cybercrime. Drawing on his background as a military veteran, Siers explained how his proof-of-work-based authentication approach can impose genuine costs on would-be attackers.Mounting Cyber Threats and the Need for ChangeModern society relies heavily on digital infrastructure, yet hacks and data breaches continue to escalate. According to Siers, losses from cybercrime in 2024 alone are estimated at 9.5 trillion dollars, far eclipsing the comparatively smaller sums often highlighted in crypto-related thefts.“There are massive cyber attacks happening every single day,” he said. “We’re just going on as if everything is normal and our entire world is anchored online.”Siers argued that current security measures, such as firewalls and password protections, often act more like puzzles that attackers can eventually solve. “At the end of the day… attackers have the advantage of time,” he pointed out. “There really is no deterrence factor.”Introducing Proof-of-Work AuthenticationAuthLN seeks to close this gap by applying Bitcoin’s proof-of-work concept to authentication. As Siers put it:“What AuthLN is doing is introducing a cost mechanism via proof of work that wasn’t there before, that you’re going to need to satisfy prior to making any authentication attempt.”In practical terms, users (especially at an enterprise or nation-state level) must place a certain amount of Bitcoin as collateral through the Lightning Network before even trying to log in. If credentials fail to match, the collateral is forfeited—instantly turning break-in attempts into a costly gamble. Conversely, authorized users who “fat-finger” a password can still be protected by arrangements between AuthLN and their organization.Why the Lightning Network?Asked why AuthLN turned to Bitcoin, Siers highlighted the ro\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nSunny Aggarwal details how Polaris unlocks effortless multi-chain trading Experiences\n\nIn a recent episode of the SlateCast, Sunny Aggarwal, Co-founder of Osmosis Labs and Polaris, joined CryptoSlate’s Editor in Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright to discuss the future of cross-chain decentralized finance (DeFi), the rise of multi-chain ecosystems, and his new venture, Polaris. Aggarwal delved into the innovations within Cosmos, the role of Bitcoin in decentralized finance, and Polaris’s goal to unify trading across various blockchain networks.Bitcoin’s Growing Integration with DeFiAggarwal started by discussing the evolving role of Bitcoin within the Cosmos ecosystem. He emphasized that the decentralized finance landscape is increasingly incorporating Bitcoin, which he sees as essential for a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem. “Bitcoin DeFi is continuing to grow and happen,” he said, referring to the expansion of DeFi layers, such as ThorChain, that bring Bitcoin into decentralized applications.Osmosis, Aggarwal’s previous project, has integrated various Bitcoin bridges, including Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), NOMIC, and CKBTC. These integrations provide additional trading options for users and help expand Bitcoin’s use case in Cosmos. “Alloyed Bitcoin is live on Osmosis and is one of our most traded assets,” Aggarwal noted, highlighting how these new offerings have significantly increased activity within the platform.Polaris: A Unified Platform for Multi-Chain TradingAggarwal’s latest venture, Polaris, aims to tackle one of DeFi’s greatest challenges: fragmented liquidity across chains. Centralized exchanges allow users to trade across multiple assets, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, on one platform, while decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have traditionally been limited by chain-specific liquidity pools. Polaris seeks to overcome this limitation by creating a platform that aggregates liquidity across ecosystems, allowing users to execute cross-chain trades seamlessly.“On centralized exchanges, you can trade Bitcoin, ETH, and SOL all in one spot, but on DEXs, you ne\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nHow Leona Hiroki's INTMAX brings stateless scaling and privacy to Ethereum\n\nIn a recent episode of the SlateCast, CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill sat down with Leona Hioki, the Co-founder of INTMAX. The conversation delved into the transformative potential of stateless zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups), which prioritize privacy, scalability, and decentralization. Hioki’s insights shed light on INTMAX’s unique approach to blockchain infrastructure, the influence of Japanese engineering culture, and the broader impact of privacy on the crypto landscape.A New Paradigm in Blockchain ScalabilityHioki introduced INTMAX as a “stateless ZK-rollup” with features like near-zero gas fees, privacy by default, and interoperability with other blockchains. Unlike traditional rollups that store transaction data on-chain, INTMAX’s stateless architecture allows data to be managed off-chain and verified using cryptographic proofs.“We’re aiming for extreme scalability by shifting data and computation to the client side,” Hioki explained.This allows for significantly reduced costs and improved privacy for users.INTMAX’s system offers a distinct trade-off compared to traditional ZK-rollups. By moving computation to users’ devices, the burden on blockchain nodes is minimized, resulting in a lightweight infrastructure.“We’ve achieved something unique in the blockchain space — extreme scalability and privacy without compromising decentralization,” Hioki noted.The Stateless Architecture AdvantageINTMAX’s stateless approach challenges the norm of blockchain rollups, which typically store transaction history on-chain. Hioki emphasized that INTMAX’s design is inspired by “Plasma Prime,” an early concept for off-chain scaling solutions. He highlighted that the key to INTMAX’s architecture is \"parallelizing computation and storage,” which shifts most of the processing work to end-user devices, reducing reliance on the blockchain’s infrastructure.“If you’ve got 5 million users, that’s 5 million nodes working in parallel instead o\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nMapping the future: Brent van der Heiden on MapMetrics, drive-to-earn, and the power of DePIN\n\nIn the latest episode of the SlateCast, CryptoSlate Editor-in-Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright sat down with Brent van der Heiden, the founder and CEO of MapMetrics. The conversation delved deep into how MapMetrics is revolutionizing navigation, data privacy, and user incentives through the emerging DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) sector.From Navigation to Data MonetizationMapMetrics introduces a “drive-to-earn” model, offering users a way to earn crypto rewards by contributing traffic and navigation data. Unlike traditional GPS services that monetize users’ data without compensation, MapMetrics puts the power — and the profit — back into users’ hands.“What we came to realize is that almost all the DePINs need a map to showcase where the data is located,” Brent explained. “So we’re building kind of like the renewed Google Maps — but for DePIN.”By enabling users to contribute data anonymously, MapMetrics positions itself as a privacy-first alternative to big tech services. “You don’t have to fill in your real name or your email address. You can just fake something and then we don’t have your data,” said Brent.Creating Value Through CrowdsourcingA cornerstone of MapMetrics’ platform is incentivized crowdsourcing. Users contribute not only live traffic data but also rich metadata like menu photos, street updates, or local business details. This data feeds into an evolving map powered by both users and AI tools.“We’re going to send people on quests and use our AI tools to fill the data gaps,” Brent explained. “For example, if you take a picture of a restaurant menu, we’ll extract dishes, ingredients, and prices. Then users can search not just by cuisine, but by the specific dish they want.”This innovative fusion of human input and machine intelligence is driving a smarter, more personalized navigation experience. It’s a shift from basic search results to AI-powered decision-making.The B2B Revenue Engine Behind the VisionTo sustain its tokenomics and rewa\n\n[Ad](https://cryptoslate.com/partnerships/)\n\n[![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2096%2096%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\\\\n\\\\\nCryptoSlate on Substackcryptoslate.substack.com\\\\\n\\\\\nGet the latest crypto news and expert insights.

India](https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/russial-oil-crypto--768x403.jpg)\n\nCover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.\n\n1082 Views\n\nRussia has started using crypto for oil trades with China and India as it seeks to bypass Western sanctions, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-leans-cryptocurrencies-oil-trade-sources-say-2025-03-14/) on March 14, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n\nAccording to the report, some Russian oil companies have settled trades in [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/), [Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/), and stablecoins like Tether’s [USDT](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/). This strategy simplifies the conversion of Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupees into Russian Rubles, enabling smoother transactions despite financial restrictions.\n\nTypically, a Chinese buyer deposits Yuan into an offshore account controlled by an intermediary. The funds are then converted into crypto and transferred through multiple accounts before reaching a final destination in Russia, where they are exchanged for Rubles.\n\nThese transactions reportedly reach tens of millions of dollars per month.\n\nAlthough crypto adoption in Russia’s oil trade remains limited, it is [part of a broader trend](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-firms-turn-to-bitcoin-stablecoins-for-global-trade-amid-sanctions/). Over the past year, the country has [introduced new regulations](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-contemplating-permanently-legalizing-stablecoins-for-cross-border-payments/) governing [crypto mining](https://cryptoslate.com/russias-bitcoin-mining-demand-triples-amid-regulatory-shifts-and-price-rally/), taxation, and international trade.\n\n[Western sanctions imposed over Russia’s](https://cryptoslate.com/tether-freezes-27m-on-garantex-forcing-halt-of-russian-linked-exchange/) military actions in Ukraine have accelerated this shift toward digital assets. However, industry sources suggest oil firms may continue using cryptocurrencies even if sanctions are lifted due to their efficiency and transaction speed.\n\n## Digital rubles challenges\n\nWhile Russia increases its reliance on crypto for trade, its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project is facing significant hurdles.\n\nLast month, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina [announced](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-delays-digital-ruble-cbdc-launch-extends-pilot-phase-indefinitely/) an indefinite delay in the launch of the digital ruble. She attributed the setback to the need for further refinements to ensure that the currency benefits all stakeholders.\n\nHowever, a recent survey indicates that the digital ruble launch was postponed due to the inadequate IT infrastructure of banks that were expected to handle the project.\n\nThe survey of Russian banking experts revealed that 30% of financial institutions are not yet prepared to support the digital ruble. Experts explained that implementing the CBDC requires banks to upgrade their IT systems to handle increased transaction volumes.\n\nMeanwhile, 20% of banking IT specialists stated that their systems are fully equipped for the digital ruble. Another 50% said they are partially prepared but need further upgrades.\n\nAt the same time, around 14% of the respondents expressed concerns over potential information security risks associated with the currency.\n\nGiven these challenges, Russia’s national digital asset initiative could face further obstacles unless major financial institutions fully prepare for its adoption.\n\n###### Mentioned in this article\n\n[![Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2020/imgresize/timthumb.php?src=https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bitcoin-logo.jpg&w=32&h=32&q=75)Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/) [![Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2020/imgresize/timthumb.php?src=https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ethereum-logo-2022.jpg&w=32&h=32&q=75)Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/) [![Tether](https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2020/imgresize/timthumb.php?src=https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tether-logo.jpg&w=32&h=32&q=75)Tether](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/) [![Tether Limited](https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2020/imgresize/timthumb.php?src=https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Tether-EURt-logo.png&w=32&h=32&q=75)Tether Limited](https://cryptoslate.com/companies/tether/)\n\n[![XRP Turbo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201280%20453%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://link.cryptoslate.com/xrpturbo)\n\nPosted In: [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/news/bitcoin/), [China](https://cryptoslate.com/places/china/), [India](https://cryptoslate.com/places/india/), [Russia](https://cryptoslate.com/places/russia/), [Adoption](https://cryptoslate.com/adoption/), [Crypto](https://cryptoslate.com/crypto/), [Featured](https://cryptoslate.com/featured-news/)\n\nPeople were interested in these podcasts\n\n[Discover more podcasts →](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-oil-firms-using-bitcoin-and-ethereum-for-cross-border-payments-with-china/#)\n\nPlay Episode\n\n25min\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nProof-of-Work security: Mike Siers on AuthLN’s bold vision for cyber defense\n\nIn a recent SlateCast episode, CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief, Liam “Akiba” Wright, spoke with AuthLN Founder Mike Siers about leveraging Bitcoin’s Lightning Network to address the massive problem of cybercrime. Drawing on his background as a military veteran, Siers explained how his proof-of-work-based authentication approach can impose genuine costs on would-be attackers.Mounting Cyber Threats and the Need for ChangeModern society relies heavily on digital infrastructure, yet hacks and data breaches continue to escalate. According to Siers, losses from cybercrime in 2024 alone are estimated at 9.5 trillion dollars, far eclipsing the comparatively smaller sums often highlighted in crypto-related thefts.“There are massive cyber attacks happening every single day,” he said. “We’re just going on as if everything is normal and our entire world is anchored online.”Siers argued that current security measures, such as firewalls and password protections, often act more like puzzles that attackers can eventually solve. “At the end of the day… attackers have the advantage of time,” he pointed out. “There really is no deterrence factor.”Introducing Proof-of-Work AuthenticationAuthLN seeks to close this gap by applying Bitcoin’s proof-of-work concept to authentication. As Siers put it:“What AuthLN is doing is introducing a cost mechanism via proof of work that wasn’t there before, that you’re going to need to satisfy prior to making any authentication attempt.”In practical terms, users (especially at an enterprise or nation-state level) must place a certain amount of Bitcoin as collateral through the Lightning Network before even trying to log in. If credentials fail to match, the collateral is forfeited—instantly turning break-in attempts into a costly gamble. Conversely, authorized users who “fat-finger” a password can still be protected by arrangements between AuthLN and their organization.Why the Lightning Network?Asked why AuthLN turned to Bitcoin, Siers highlighted the ro\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nSunny Aggarwal details how Polaris unlocks effortless multi-chain trading Experiences\n\nIn a recent episode of the SlateCast, Sunny Aggarwal, Co-founder of Osmosis Labs and Polaris, joined CryptoSlate’s Editor in Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright to discuss the future of cross-chain decentralized finance (DeFi), the rise of multi-chain ecosystems, and his new venture, Polaris. Aggarwal delved into the innovations within Cosmos, the role of Bitcoin in decentralized finance, and Polaris’s goal to unify trading across various blockchain networks.Bitcoin’s Growing Integration with DeFiAggarwal started by discussing the evolving role of Bitcoin within the Cosmos ecosystem. He emphasized that the decentralized finance landscape is increasingly incorporating Bitcoin, which he sees as essential for a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem. “Bitcoin DeFi is continuing to grow and happen,” he said, referring to the expansion of DeFi layers, such as ThorChain, that bring Bitcoin into decentralized applications.Osmosis, Aggarwal’s previous project, has integrated various Bitcoin bridges, including Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), NOMIC, and CKBTC. These integrations provide additional trading options for users and help expand Bitcoin’s use case in Cosmos. “Alloyed Bitcoin is live on Osmosis and is one of our most traded assets,” Aggarwal noted, highlighting how these new offerings have significantly increased activity within the platform.Polaris: A Unified Platform for Multi-Chain TradingAggarwal’s latest venture, Polaris, aims to tackle one of DeFi’s greatest challenges: fragmented liquidity across chains. Centralized exchanges allow users to trade across multiple assets, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, on one platform, while decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have traditionally been limited by chain-specific liquidity pools. Polaris seeks to overcome this limitation by creating a platform that aggregates liquidity across ecosystems, allowing users to execute cross-chain trades seamlessly.“On centralized exchanges, you can trade Bitcoin, ETH, and SOL all in one spot, but on DEXs, you ne\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nHow Leona Hiroki's INTMAX brings stateless scaling and privacy to Ethereum\n\nIn a recent episode of the SlateCast, CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill sat down with Leona Hioki, the Co-founder of INTMAX. The conversation delved into the transformative potential of stateless zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups), which prioritize privacy, scalability, and decentralization. Hioki’s insights shed light on INTMAX’s unique approach to blockchain infrastructure, the influence of Japanese engineering culture, and the broader impact of privacy on the crypto landscape.A New Paradigm in Blockchain ScalabilityHioki introduced INTMAX as a “stateless ZK-rollup” with features like near-zero gas fees, privacy by default, and interoperability with other blockchains. Unlike traditional rollups that store transaction data on-chain, INTMAX’s stateless architecture allows data to be managed off-chain and verified using cryptographic proofs.“We’re aiming for extreme scalability by shifting data and computation to the client side,” Hioki explained.This allows for significantly reduced costs and improved privacy for users.INTMAX’s system offers a distinct trade-off compared to traditional ZK-rollups. By moving computation to users’ devices, the burden on blockchain nodes is minimized, resulting in a lightweight infrastructure.“We’ve achieved something unique in the blockchain space — extreme scalability and privacy without compromising decentralization,” Hioki noted.The Stateless Architecture AdvantageINTMAX’s stateless approach challenges the norm of blockchain rollups, which typically store transaction history on-chain. Hioki emphasized that INTMAX’s design is inspired by “Plasma Prime,” an early concept for off-chain scaling solutions. He highlighted that the key to INTMAX’s architecture is \"parallelizing computation and storage,” which shifts most of the processing work to end-user devices, reducing reliance on the blockchain’s infrastructure.“If you’ve got 5 million users, that’s 5 million nodes working in parallel instead o\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nMapping the future: Brent van der Heiden on MapMetrics, drive-to-earn, and the power of DePIN\n\nIn the latest episode of the SlateCast, CryptoSlate Editor-in-Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright sat down with Brent van der Heiden, the founder and CEO of MapMetrics. The conversation delved deep into how MapMetrics is revolutionizing navigation, data privacy, and user incentives through the emerging DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) sector.From Navigation to Data MonetizationMapMetrics introduces a “drive-to-earn” model, offering users a way to earn crypto rewards by contributing traffic and navigation data. Unlike traditional GPS services that monetize users’ data without compensation, MapMetrics puts the power — and the profit — back into users’ hands.“What we came to realize is that almost all the DePINs need a map to showcase where the data is located,” Brent explained. “So we’re building kind of like the renewed Google Maps — but for DePIN.”By enabling users to contribute data anonymously, MapMetrics positions itself as a privacy-first alternative to big tech services. “You don’t have to fill in your real name or your email address. You can just fake something and then we don’t have your data,” said Brent.Creating Value Through CrowdsourcingA cornerstone of MapMetrics’ platform is incentivized crowdsourcing. Users contribute not only live traffic data but also rich metadata like menu photos, street updates, or local business details. This data feeds into an evolving map powered by both users and AI tools.“We’re going to send people on quests and use our AI tools to fill the data gaps,” Brent explained. “For example, if you take a picture of a restaurant menu, we’ll extract dishes, ingredients, and prices. Then users can search not just by cuisine, but by the specific dish they want.”This innovative fusion of human input and machine intelligence is driving a smarter, more personalized navigation experience. It’s a shift from basic search results to AI-powered decision-making.The B2B Revenue Engine Behind the VisionTo sustain its tokenomics and rewa\n\n[Ad](https://cryptoslate.com/partnerships/)\n\n[![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2096%2096%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\\\\n\\\\\nCryptoSlate on Substackcryptoslate.substack.com\\\\\n\\\\\nGet the latest crypto news and expert insights.

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.\n\n1082 Views\n\nRussia has started using crypto for oil trades with China and India as it seeks to bypass Western sanctions, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-leans-cryptocurrencies-oil-trade-sources-say-2025-03-14/) on March 14, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n\nAccording to the report, some Russian oil companies have settled trades in [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/), [Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/), and stablecoins like Tether’s [USDT](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/). This strategy simplifies the conversion of Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupees into Russian Rubles, enabling smoother transactions despite financial restrictions.\n\nTypically, a Chinese buyer deposits Yuan into an offshore account controlled by an intermediary. The funds are then converted into crypto and transferred through multiple accounts before reaching a final destination in Russia, where they are exchanged for Rubles.\n\nThese transactions reportedly reach tens of millions of dollars per month.\n\nAlthough crypto adoption in Russia’s oil trade remains limited, it is [part of a broader trend](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-firms-turn-to-bitcoin-stablecoins-for-global-trade-amid-sanctions/). Over the past year, the country has [introduced new regulations](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-contemplating-permanently-legalizing-stablecoins-for-cross-border-payments/) governing [crypto mining](https://cryptoslate.com/russias-bitcoin-mining-demand-triples-amid-regulatory-shifts-and-price-rally/), taxation, and international trade.\n\n[Western sanctions imposed over Russia’s](https://cryptoslate.com/tether-freezes-27m-on-garantex-forcing-halt-of-russian-linked-exchange/) military actions in Ukraine have accelerated this shift toward digital assets. However, industry sources suggest oil firms may continue using cryptocurrencies even if sanctions are lifted due to their efficiency and transaction speed.\n\n## Digital rubles challenges\n\nWhile Russia increases its reliance on crypto for trade, its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project is facing significant hurdles.\n\nLast month, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina [announced](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-delays-digital-ruble-cbdc-launch-extends-pilot-phase-indefinitely/) an indefinite delay in the launch of the digital ruble. She attributed the setback to the need for further refinements to ensure that the currency benefits all stakeholders.\n\nHowever, a recent survey indicates that the digital ruble launch was postponed due to the inadequate IT infrastructure of banks that were expected to handle the project.\n\nThe survey of Russian banking experts revealed that 30% of financial institutions are not yet prepared to support the digital ruble. Experts explained that implementing the CBDC requires banks to upgrade their IT systems to handle increased transaction volumes.\n\nMeanwhile, 20% of banking IT specialists stated that their systems are fully equipped for the digital ruble. Another 50% said they are partially prepared but need further upgrades.\n\nAt the same time, around 14% of the respondents expressed concerns over potential information security risks associated with the currency.\n\nGiven these challenges, Russia’s national digital asset initiative could face further obstacles unless major financial institutions fully prepare for its adoption.\n\n###### Mentioned in this article\n\n[![Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2020/imgresize/timthumb.php?src=https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bitcoin-logo.jpg&w=32&h=32&q=75)Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/) [![Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2020/imgresize/timthumb.php?src=https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ethereum-logo-2022.jpg&w=32&h=32&q=75)Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/) [![Tether](https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2020/imgresize/timthumb.php?src=https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tether-logo.jpg&w=32&h=32&q=75)Tether](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/) [![Tether Limited](https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2020/imgresize/timthumb.php?src=https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Tether-EURt-logo.png&w=32&h=32&q=75)Tether Limited](https://cryptoslate.com/companies/tether/)\n\n[![XRP Turbo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201280%20453%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://link.cryptoslate.com/xrpturbo)\n\nPosted In: [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/news/bitcoin/), [China](https://cryptoslate.com/places/china/), [India](https://cryptoslate.com/places/india/), [Russia](https://cryptoslate.com/places/russia/), [Adoption](https://cryptoslate.com/adoption/), [Crypto](https://cryptoslate.com/crypto/), [Featured](https://cryptoslate.com/featured-news/)\n\nPeople were interested in these podcasts\n\n[Discover more podcasts →](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-oil-firms-using-bitcoin-and-ethereum-for-cross-border-payments-with-china/#)\n\nPlay Episode\n\n25min\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nProof-of-Work security: Mike Siers on AuthLN’s bold vision for cyber defense\n\nIn a recent SlateCast episode, CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief, Liam “Akiba” Wright, spoke with AuthLN Founder Mike Siers about leveraging Bitcoin’s Lightning Network to address the massive problem of cybercrime. Drawing on his background as a military veteran, Siers explained how his proof-of-work-based authentication approach can impose genuine costs on would-be attackers.Mounting Cyber Threats and the Need for ChangeModern society relies heavily on digital infrastructure, yet hacks and data breaches continue to escalate. According to Siers, losses from cybercrime in 2024 alone are estimated at 9.5 trillion dollars, far eclipsing the comparatively smaller sums often highlighted in crypto-related thefts.“There are massive cyber attacks happening every single day,” he said. “We’re just going on as if everything is normal and our entire world is anchored online.”Siers argued that current security measures, such as firewalls and password protections, often act more like puzzles that attackers can eventually solve. “At the end of the day… attackers have the advantage of time,” he pointed out. “There really is no deterrence factor.”Introducing Proof-of-Work AuthenticationAuthLN seeks to close this gap by applying Bitcoin’s proof-of-work concept to authentication. As Siers put it:“What AuthLN is doing is introducing a cost mechanism via proof of work that wasn’t there before, that you’re going to need to satisfy prior to making any authentication attempt.”In practical terms, users (especially at an enterprise or nation-state level) must place a certain amount of Bitcoin as collateral through the Lightning Network before even trying to log in. If credentials fail to match, the collateral is forfeited—instantly turning break-in attempts into a costly gamble. Conversely, authorized users who “fat-finger” a password can still be protected by arrangements between AuthLN and their organization.Why the Lightning Network?Asked why AuthLN turned to Bitcoin, Siers highlighted the ro\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nSunny Aggarwal details how Polaris unlocks effortless multi-chain trading Experiences\n\nIn a recent episode of the SlateCast, Sunny Aggarwal, Co-founder of Osmosis Labs and Polaris, joined CryptoSlate’s Editor in Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright to discuss the future of cross-chain decentralized finance (DeFi), the rise of multi-chain ecosystems, and his new venture, Polaris. Aggarwal delved into the innovations within Cosmos, the role of Bitcoin in decentralized finance, and Polaris’s goal to unify trading across various blockchain networks.Bitcoin’s Growing Integration with DeFiAggarwal started by discussing the evolving role of Bitcoin within the Cosmos ecosystem. He emphasized that the decentralized finance landscape is increasingly incorporating Bitcoin, which he sees as essential for a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem. “Bitcoin DeFi is continuing to grow and happen,” he said, referring to the expansion of DeFi layers, such as ThorChain, that bring Bitcoin into decentralized applications.Osmosis, Aggarwal’s previous project, has integrated various Bitcoin bridges, including Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), NOMIC, and CKBTC. These integrations provide additional trading options for users and help expand Bitcoin’s use case in Cosmos. “Alloyed Bitcoin is live on Osmosis and is one of our most traded assets,” Aggarwal noted, highlighting how these new offerings have significantly increased activity within the platform.Polaris: A Unified Platform for Multi-Chain TradingAggarwal’s latest venture, Polaris, aims to tackle one of DeFi’s greatest challenges: fragmented liquidity across chains. Centralized exchanges allow users to trade across multiple assets, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, on one platform, while decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have traditionally been limited by chain-specific liquidity pools. Polaris seeks to overcome this limitation by creating a platform that aggregates liquidity across ecosystems, allowing users to execute cross-chain trades seamlessly.“On centralized exchanges, you can trade Bitcoin, ETH, and SOL all in one spot, but on DEXs, you ne\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nHow Leona Hiroki's INTMAX brings stateless scaling and privacy to Ethereum\n\nIn a recent episode of the SlateCast, CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill sat down with Leona Hioki, the Co-founder of INTMAX. The conversation delved into the transformative potential of stateless zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups), which prioritize privacy, scalability, and decentralization. Hioki’s insights shed light on INTMAX’s unique approach to blockchain infrastructure, the influence of Japanese engineering culture, and the broader impact of privacy on the crypto landscape.A New Paradigm in Blockchain ScalabilityHioki introduced INTMAX as a “stateless ZK-rollup” with features like near-zero gas fees, privacy by default, and interoperability with other blockchains. Unlike traditional rollups that store transaction data on-chain, INTMAX’s stateless architecture allows data to be managed off-chain and verified using cryptographic proofs.“We’re aiming for extreme scalability by shifting data and computation to the client side,” Hioki explained.This allows for significantly reduced costs and improved privacy for users.INTMAX’s system offers a distinct trade-off compared to traditional ZK-rollups. By moving computation to users’ devices, the burden on blockchain nodes is minimized, resulting in a lightweight infrastructure.“We’ve achieved something unique in the blockchain space — extreme scalability and privacy without compromising decentralization,” Hioki noted.The Stateless Architecture AdvantageINTMAX’s stateless approach challenges the norm of blockchain rollups, which typically store transaction history on-chain. Hioki emphasized that INTMAX’s design is inspired by “Plasma Prime,” an early concept for off-chain scaling solutions. He highlighted that the key to INTMAX’s architecture is \"parallelizing computation and storage,” which shifts most of the processing work to end-user devices, reducing reliance on the blockchain’s infrastructure.“If you’ve got 5 million users, that’s 5 million nodes working in parallel instead o\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nMapping the future: Brent van der Heiden on MapMetrics, drive-to-earn, and the power of DePIN\n\nIn the latest episode of the SlateCast, CryptoSlate Editor-in-Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright sat down with Brent van der Heiden, the founder and CEO of MapMetrics. The conversation delved deep into how MapMetrics is revolutionizing navigation, data privacy, and user incentives through the emerging DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) sector.From Navigation to Data MonetizationMapMetrics introduces a “drive-to-earn” model, offering users a way to earn crypto rewards by contributing traffic and navigation data. Unlike traditional GPS services that monetize users’ data without compensation, MapMetrics puts the power — and the profit — back into users’ hands.“What we came to realize is that almost all the DePINs need a map to showcase where the data is located,” Brent explained. “So we’re building kind of like the renewed Google Maps — but for DePIN.”By enabling users to contribute data anonymously, MapMetrics positions itself as a privacy-first alternative to big tech services. “You don’t have to fill in your real name or your email address. You can just fake something and then we don’t have your data,” said Brent.Creating Value Through CrowdsourcingA cornerstone of MapMetrics’ platform is incentivized crowdsourcing. Users contribute not only live traffic data but also rich metadata like menu photos, street updates, or local business details. This data feeds into an evolving map powered by both users and AI tools.“We’re going to send people on quests and use our AI tools to fill the data gaps,” Brent explained. “For example, if you take a picture of a restaurant menu, we’ll extract dishes, ingredients, and prices. Then users can search not just by cuisine, but by the specific dish they want.”This innovative fusion of human input and machine intelligence is driving a smarter, more personalized navigation experience. It’s a shift from basic search results to AI-powered decision-making.The B2B Revenue Engine Behind the VisionTo sustain its tokenomics and rewa\n\n[Ad](https://cryptoslate.com/partnerships/)\n\n[![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2096%2096%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\\\\n\\\\\nCryptoSlate on Substackcryptoslate.substack.com\\\\\n\\\\\nGet the latest crypto news and expert insights.

The trader had invested more than 160,234 ETH when the price was around $1,900, but with a liquidation price set at $1,877, the sudden drop forced the position to close. [Data](https://x.com/lookonchain/status/1899741688689463342/photo/1) from Lookonchain revealed that the trader had moved all their Bitcoin holdings into this leveraged ETH trade before the loss.\n\nThe liquidation happened during a period of heightened market instability, partly driven by global trade tensions. The European Union’s recent retaliatory tariffs have caused uncertainty, affecting both crypto and traditional financial markets. Ether, in particular, has been in a steep decline since Dec. 16, 2024, when it peaked above $4,100. It has since lost over 53% of its value. Analysts from Bitfinex attributed the drop to macroeconomic concerns and the Ethereum network’s high transaction fees discouraging new projects. “A lack of new projects or builders moving to ETH, primarily due to high operating fees, is likely the principal reason behind the lackluster performance of ETH,” the analysts [said](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ether-1-8k-correction-global-tariff-fears-eth-etf-outflows).\n\nThe broader crypto market has also been affected, with Bitcoin and other assets experiencing a sell-off. Many traders are hesitant due to fears about the economic impact of ongoing trade disputes. While ETH’s decline is partially due to external factors, internal network issues have also played a role. The Ethereum network has seen reduced developer activity, which has weakened investor confidence.\n\nAdding to the downward pressure, U.S. spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have struggled, recording net negative outflows for four consecutive weeks. [Data](https://sosovalue.com/assets/etf/Total_Crypto_ETH_ETF_Fund_Flow?page=usETH) from Sosovalue shows that investors pulled more than $119 million from these ETFs last week alone. The lack of inflows limits ETH’s chances of a price rebound, further straining the market.\n\nThe incident has once again highlighted the risks of leveraged trading. While borrowing funds can amplify potential gains, it also increases exposure to severe losses. Even small price fluctuations can trigger large liquidations, as seen in this case. Market analysts believe ETH’s next key level to watch is $1,800, which could serve as a strong support or another breaking point.\n\nWith global economic uncertainty continuing and crypto markets already under pressure, traders are approaching investments cautiously. Whether ETH stabilizes or continues its decline will depend on both macroeconomic trends and internal developments within the Ethereum network.

Binance’s billionaire founder, Changpeng Zhao, who served four months in prison after pleading guilty to violating anti-money-laundering requirements, has been pushing for the Trump administration to grant him a pardon, sources added.\n\nFollowing the report, Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance and its ex-CEO, [stated in a post to X:](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4089128&headline=$BTC;MSTR;COIN;MARA;RIOT;BTBT;BITF;WULF;GREE;SDIG;CORZ;$ECON;SPY;SPX-Changpeng-Zhao-says-WSJ-article-got-the-facts-wrong-about-Binance&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=COIN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) “Sorry to disappoint. The WSJ article got the facts wrong. More than 20 people have told me they were asked by the WSJ (and another media), ‘Can you confirm that CZ made some deal for a pardon?’ They probably asked hundreds of people to have 20 people reach out to me. In essence, they tried hard to make a story to report. Fact: I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with … well, anyone. No felon would mind a pardon, especially being the only one in US history who was ever sentenced to prison for a single BSA charge. Feels like the article is motivated as an attack on the President and crypto, and the residual forces of the ‘war on crypto’ from the last administration are still at work. I am always happy to make crypto great everywhere, US and the rest of the world. It’s good to see that even WSJ thinks I should be pardoned.”\n\n**COINBASE SECURES REGISTRATION IN INDIA:** Coinbase [(COIN)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=COIN&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) announced Tuesday it [has registered with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4087848&headline=COIN-Coinbase-secures-registration-in-India&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=COIN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), which marks a significant milestone in its international expansion strategy. The company plans to launch its initial retail services later this year, followed by additional investment and products in India thereafter. “We’re committed to building in markets that believe in the potential of crypto and onchain innovation,” said John O’Loghlen, Regional Managing Director for APAC at Coinbase. “India represents one of the most exciting market opportunities in the world today, and we’re proud to deepen our investment here in full compliance with local regulations.”\n\nStory Continues\n\nAdditionally on Tuesday, Mizuho lowered the firm’s price target on Coinbase [to $217 from $280 and kept a Neutral rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4087037&headline=COIN-Mizuho-cuts-Coinbase-target-calls--pullback-overdone&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=COIN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares. The firm said that since its last model update on February 20, the price of [bitcoin](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) has fallen from $98,000 to $79,000 and Coinbase shares are down 30%. While some multiple compression is warranted due to lower multiples across technology, the move in Coinbase shares is overdone, the analyst said. Mizuho believes the stock should trade closer to $217. While it sees some upside from here, it remains Neutral given the longer-term risk of pricing pressure from increased competition across the crypto trading space. Mizuho cited lower market multiples for the target cut.\n\n**BIT DIGITAL REPORTS FY24 RESULTS:** On Friday, Bit Digital [(BTBT)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=BTBT&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) reported FY24 [earnings per share of 19c on revenue of $108.1M,](https://bit-digital.com/press-releases/bit-digital-inc-announces-fiscal-year-2024-financial-results/?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) which compared to a loss per share of (16c) on revenue of $44.9M last year. The company earned 949.9 bitcoins during 2024, a 37% decrease from the prior year, and treasury holdings of BTC and ETH were 741.9 and 27,623.2, respectively, with a fair market value of approximately $69.3M and $92.1M on December 31, respectively.\n\nThe company said, “2024 marked a pivotal shift for Bit Digital. Our business was historically driven by digital asset mining, but the successful launch and rapid expansion of our HPC business fundamentally reshaped our company. This evolution drove over 140% revenue growth, with these new business lines contributing nearly half of total revenue. A defining milestone in this transformation was our acquisition of Enovum Data Centers in October. More than just an infrastructure expansion, Enovum provided us with a proven team, operational expertise, and a scalable platform to develop and operate data centers. It also introduced colocation services as a new business line, further diversifying our revenue streams and strengthening our [AI](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) compute capabilities. Bitcoin mining remained a key revenue contributor, generating $58.6M, a 32% increase year-over-year. However, as our HPC business scaled, mining’s share of total revenue declined to 54% in 2024, and further to 40% in Q424, compared to 98% in 2023. This shift underscores our strategic pivot toward infrastructure-driven revenue streams while maintaining disciplined mining operations.”\n\n**ANALYSTS UPDATES BITCOIN MINER MODELS:** On Thursday, JPMorgan downgraded Cipher Mining [(](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=CIFR&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) CIFR) to [Neutral from Overweight without a price target.](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088576&headline=CIFR-Cipher-Mining-just-downgraded-at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=CIFR&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) The firm updated bitcoin miner price targets and models to reflect the Q4 results and changes in bitcoin price and the network hash rate. The firm now sees less upside potential relative to peers for Cipher Mining shares. Cipher could sign a high performance compute deal at its Barber Lake site, which could drive upside, but deals can take up to nine months to negotiate and finalize, the analyst said.\n\nJPMorgan also lowered the firm’s price target on Mara Holdings [(MARA)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=MARA&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [$18 from $23 and kept a Neutral rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088580&headline=MARA-Mara-Holdings-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=MARA&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares as well as on CleanSpark [(](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=CLSK&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) CLSK) to [$12 from $17 and kept an Overweight rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088579&headline=CLSK-CleanSpark-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=CLSK&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares and on Riot Platforms [(RIOT)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=RIOT&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [$13 from $16 and kept an Overweight rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088581&headline=RIOT-Riot-Platforms-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=RIOT&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares.\n\nAdditionally, the firm upgraded IREN [(IREN)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=IREN&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $12, down from $15](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088578&headline=IREN-IREN-just-upgraded-at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=IREN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral). JPMorgan named IREN its top pick citing the company’s “strong” mining operations and high performance computing “optionality.” The shares have “been overly punished” year-to-date, and offer 70% upside at current levels, which could prove conservative if IREN announces an HPC deal with a name-brand tenant, the analyst said.\n\n**HIVE PRICE TARGET LOWERED:** Cantor Fitzgerald lowered the firm’s price target on [Hive](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hive?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) Digital [(HIVE)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=HIVE&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on Tuesday [to $8 from $11 and kept an Overweight rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4087369&headline=HIVE-Hive-Digital-price-target-lowered-by--at-Cantor-Fitzgerald-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=HIVE&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares. Hive said it mined 89 bitcoin during the month of February, or 3.1 bitcoin per day, a decrease from 102 bitcoin mined in January, and its share of the overall bitcoin network decreased to 0.69% from 0.73% on a peak hash rate basis, the analyst said. Cantor continues to believe that current levels represent an attractive risk/reward, as the firm is confident in Hive’s ability to execute on its bitcoin mining and AI Cloud targets, which will represent 300% hash rate growth and $100M in annualized run-rate revenue in 2025, respectively.\n\n**CRYPTO STOCK PLAYS:** Publicly traded companies in the space include Bit Digital, Coinbase, Core Scientific [(CORZ)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=CORZ&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), Greenidge Generation [(GREE)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=GREE&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), Mara Holdings, Strategy [(MSTR)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=MSTR&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), Riot Platforms, Stronghold Digital Mining [(SDIG)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=SDIG&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) and TeraWulf [(WULF)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=WULF&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral).\n\n**PRICE ACTION:** As of time of writing, bitcoin dropped about 6% this week to $83,160 in U.S. dollars, according to CoinDesk.\n\n_Published first on [TheFly](https://thefly.com/?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

Binance’s billionaire founder, Changpeng Zhao, who served four months in prison after pleading guilty to violating anti-money-laundering requirements, has been pushing for the Trump administration to grant him a pardon, sources added.\n\nFollowing the report, Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance and its ex-CEO, [stated in a post to X:](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4089128&headline=$BTC;MSTR;COIN;MARA;RIOT;BTBT;BITF;WULF;GREE;SDIG;CORZ;$ECON;SPY;SPX-Changpeng-Zhao-says-WSJ-article-got-the-facts-wrong-about-Binance&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=COIN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) “Sorry to disappoint. The WSJ article got the facts wrong. More than 20 people have told me they were asked by the WSJ (and another media), ‘Can you confirm that CZ made some deal for a pardon?’ They probably asked hundreds of people to have 20 people reach out to me. In essence, they tried hard to make a story to report. Fact: I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with … well, anyone. No felon would mind a pardon, especially being the only one in US history who was ever sentenced to prison for a single BSA charge. Feels like the article is motivated as an attack on the President and crypto, and the residual forces of the ‘war on crypto’ from the last administration are still at work. I am always happy to make crypto great everywhere, US and the rest of the world. It’s good to see that even WSJ thinks I should be pardoned.”\n\n**COINBASE SECURES REGISTRATION IN INDIA:** Coinbase [(COIN)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=COIN&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) announced Tuesday it [has registered with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4087848&headline=COIN-Coinbase-secures-registration-in-India&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=COIN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), which marks a significant milestone in its international expansion strategy. The company plans to launch its initial retail services later this year, followed by additional investment and products in India thereafter. “We’re committed to building in markets that believe in the potential of crypto and onchain innovation,” said John O’Loghlen, Regional Managing Director for APAC at Coinbase. “India represents one of the most exciting market opportunities in the world today, and we’re proud to deepen our investment here in full compliance with local regulations.”\n\nStory Continues\n\nAdditionally on Tuesday, Mizuho lowered the firm’s price target on Coinbase [to $217 from $280 and kept a Neutral rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4087037&headline=COIN-Mizuho-cuts-Coinbase-target-calls--pullback-overdone&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=COIN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares. The firm said that since its last model update on February 20, the price of [bitcoin](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) has fallen from $98,000 to $79,000 and Coinbase shares are down 30%. While some multiple compression is warranted due to lower multiples across technology, the move in Coinbase shares is overdone, the analyst said. Mizuho believes the stock should trade closer to $217. While it sees some upside from here, it remains Neutral given the longer-term risk of pricing pressure from increased competition across the crypto trading space. Mizuho cited lower market multiples for the target cut.\n\n**BIT DIGITAL REPORTS FY24 RESULTS:** On Friday, Bit Digital [(BTBT)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=BTBT&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) reported FY24 [earnings per share of 19c on revenue of $108.1M,](https://bit-digital.com/press-releases/bit-digital-inc-announces-fiscal-year-2024-financial-results/?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) which compared to a loss per share of (16c) on revenue of $44.9M last year. The company earned 949.9 bitcoins during 2024, a 37% decrease from the prior year, and treasury holdings of BTC and ETH were 741.9 and 27,623.2, respectively, with a fair market value of approximately $69.3M and $92.1M on December 31, respectively.\n\nThe company said, “2024 marked a pivotal shift for Bit Digital. Our business was historically driven by digital asset mining, but the successful launch and rapid expansion of our HPC business fundamentally reshaped our company. This evolution drove over 140% revenue growth, with these new business lines contributing nearly half of total revenue. A defining milestone in this transformation was our acquisition of Enovum Data Centers in October. More than just an infrastructure expansion, Enovum provided us with a proven team, operational expertise, and a scalable platform to develop and operate data centers. It also introduced colocation services as a new business line, further diversifying our revenue streams and strengthening our [AI](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) compute capabilities. Bitcoin mining remained a key revenue contributor, generating $58.6M, a 32% increase year-over-year. However, as our HPC business scaled, mining’s share of total revenue declined to 54% in 2024, and further to 40% in Q424, compared to 98% in 2023. This shift underscores our strategic pivot toward infrastructure-driven revenue streams while maintaining disciplined mining operations.”\n\n**ANALYSTS UPDATES BITCOIN MINER MODELS:** On Thursday, JPMorgan downgraded Cipher Mining [(](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=CIFR&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) CIFR) to [Neutral from Overweight without a price target.](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088576&headline=CIFR-Cipher-Mining-just-downgraded-at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=CIFR&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) The firm updated bitcoin miner price targets and models to reflect the Q4 results and changes in bitcoin price and the network hash rate. The firm now sees less upside potential relative to peers for Cipher Mining shares. Cipher could sign a high performance compute deal at its Barber Lake site, which could drive upside, but deals can take up to nine months to negotiate and finalize, the analyst said.\n\nJPMorgan also lowered the firm’s price target on Mara Holdings [(MARA)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=MARA&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [$18 from $23 and kept a Neutral rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088580&headline=MARA-Mara-Holdings-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=MARA&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares as well as on CleanSpark [(](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=CLSK&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) CLSK) to [$12 from $17 and kept an Overweight rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088579&headline=CLSK-CleanSpark-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=CLSK&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares and on Riot Platforms [(RIOT)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=RIOT&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [$13 from $16 and kept an Overweight rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088581&headline=RIOT-Riot-Platforms-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=RIOT&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares.\n\nAdditionally, the firm upgraded IREN [(IREN)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=IREN&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $12, down from $15](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088578&headline=IREN-IREN-just-upgraded-at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=IREN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral).

Mizuho cited lower market multiples for the target cut.\n\n**BIT DIGITAL REPORTS FY24 RESULTS:** On Friday, Bit Digital [(BTBT)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=BTBT&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) reported FY24 [earnings per share of 19c on revenue of $108.1M,](https://bit-digital.com/press-releases/bit-digital-inc-announces-fiscal-year-2024-financial-results/?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) which compared to a loss per share of (16c) on revenue of $44.9M last year. The company earned 949.9 bitcoins during 2024, a 37% decrease from the prior year, and treasury holdings of BTC and ETH were 741.9 and 27,623.2, respectively, with a fair market value of approximately $69.3M and $92.1M on December 31, respectively.\n\nThe company said, “2024 marked a pivotal shift for Bit Digital. Our business was historically driven by digital asset mining, but the successful launch and rapid expansion of our HPC business fundamentally reshaped our company. This evolution drove over 140% revenue growth, with these new business lines contributing nearly half of total revenue. A defining milestone in this transformation was our acquisition of Enovum Data Centers in October. More than just an infrastructure expansion, Enovum provided us with a proven team, operational expertise, and a scalable platform to develop and operate data centers. It also introduced colocation services as a new business line, further diversifying our revenue streams and strengthening our [AI](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) compute capabilities. Bitcoin mining remained a key revenue contributor, generating $58.6M, a 32% increase year-over-year. However, as our HPC business scaled, mining’s share of total revenue declined to 54% in 2024, and further to 40% in Q424, compared to 98% in 2023. This shift underscores our strategic pivot toward infrastructure-driven revenue streams while maintaining disciplined mining operations.”\n\n**ANALYSTS UPDATES BITCOIN MINER MODELS:** On Thursday, JPMorgan downgraded Cipher Mining [(](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=CIFR&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) CIFR) to [Neutral from Overweight without a price target.](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088576&headline=CIFR-Cipher-Mining-just-downgraded-at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=CIFR&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) The firm updated bitcoin miner price targets and models to reflect the Q4 results and changes in bitcoin price and the network hash rate. The firm now sees less upside potential relative to peers for Cipher Mining shares. Cipher could sign a high performance compute deal at its Barber Lake site, which could drive upside, but deals can take up to nine months to negotiate and finalize, the analyst said.\n\nJPMorgan also lowered the firm’s price target on Mara Holdings [(MARA)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=MARA&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [$18 from $23 and kept a Neutral rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088580&headline=MARA-Mara-Holdings-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=MARA&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares as well as on CleanSpark [(](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=CLSK&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) CLSK) to [$12 from $17 and kept an Overweight rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088579&headline=CLSK-CleanSpark-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=CLSK&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares and on Riot Platforms [(RIOT)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=RIOT&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [$13 from $16 and kept an Overweight rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088581&headline=RIOT-Riot-Platforms-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=RIOT&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares.\n\nAdditionally, the firm upgraded IREN [(IREN)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=IREN&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $12, down from $15](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088578&headline=IREN-IREN-just-upgraded-at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=IREN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral). JPMorgan named IREN its top pick citing the company’s “strong” mining operations and high performance computing “optionality.” The shares have “been overly punished” year-to-date, and offer 70% upside at current levels, which could prove conservative if IREN announces an HPC deal with a name-brand tenant, the analyst said.\n\n**HIVE PRICE TARGET LOWERED:** Cantor Fitzgerald lowered the firm’s price target on [Hive](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hive?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) Digital [(HIVE)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=HIVE&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on Tuesday [to $8 from $11 and kept an Overweight rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4087369&headline=HIVE-Hive-Digital-price-target-lowered-by--at-Cantor-Fitzgerald-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=HIVE&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares. Hive said it mined 89 bitcoin during the month of February, or 3.1 bitcoin per day, a decrease from 102 bitcoin mined in January, and its share of the overall bitcoin network decreased to 0.69% from 0.73% on a peak hash rate basis, the analyst said. Cantor continues to believe that current levels represent an attractive risk/reward, as the firm is confident in Hive’s ability to execute on its bitcoin mining and AI Cloud targets, which will represent 300% hash rate growth and $100M in annualized run-rate revenue in 2025, respectively.\n\n**CRYPTO STOCK PLAYS:** Publicly traded companies in the space include Bit Digital, Coinbase, Core Scientific [(CORZ)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=CORZ&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), Greenidge Generation [(GREE)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=GREE&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), Mara Holdings, Strategy [(MSTR)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=MSTR&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), Riot Platforms, Stronghold Digital Mining [(SDIG)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=SDIG&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) and TeraWulf [(WULF)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=WULF&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral).\n\n**PRICE ACTION:** As of time of writing, bitcoin dropped about 6% this week to $83,160 in U.S. dollars, according to CoinDesk.\n\n_Published first on [TheFly](https://thefly.com/?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

While this might signal an incoming crypto rally, do not ignore the market's inherent volatility and risks associated with hype-driven investments. Moreover, regulatory ambiguity around this asset class is another reason you should be careful while investing in this asset.\n\n![Should I invest in Bitcoin?](https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-119044145,width-300,height-225,imgsize-159732,resizemode-75/should-i-invest-in-bitcoin.jpg)Getty ImagesBefore investing in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, make sure to check the authenticity of the application you are using. Also, do not invest in coins that are merely driven by hype, and have no actual, real-world value.\n\nWith bears champing at the bit and dragging down the overall market sentiment, an unlikely spike has managed to lift a section of Indian investors. The recent announcement by US President [Donald Trump](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/panache/panache-people-101/donald-trump/profileshow/79057526.cms) to create a “strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital assets stockpile” has sent the [crypto](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency) enthusiasts in India into a tizzy. Hoping to cash in on what they believe could be the next big rally, they have led a surge in trading volumes, with CoinDCX reporting a 36% hike and Mudrex registering a 30% spike.\n\nIncome Tax Guide\n\n[Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/income-tax-slabs) [Income Tax Calculator 2025](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/calculators/income-tax-calculator) [New Income Tax Bill 2025](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/new-income-tax-bill-2025)\n\nWhile the reserve will only include Bitcoin, already owned by the US government, not acquired or actively bought, the digital asset stockpile will consist of tokens other than the Bitcoin—Ethereum (ETH), [Solana](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/solana) (SOL), [Ripple](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ripple) ( [XRP](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/xrp)), and [Cardano](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/cardano) (ADA), which will also not be acquired. The announcement is significant because it’s the first time that Bitcoin has been recognised as a reserve asset of the US government.\n\n“This sends a powerful message to the world about how blockchain and digital assets are becoming mainstream,” says Sumit Gupta, co-founder of CoinDCX. Agrees Edul Patel, Co-founder of Mudrex: “There is a strong future for crypto and Bitcoin globally, not just in the US.”\n\n## Chase hype, pay the price\n\nCryptocurrency is a sentiment-driven market, and its volatile nature is no secret. In fact, Trump’s earlier promise of such a reserve and ease of regulation had seen the token surge to an all-time high of $109,071.8 in January.\n\nWhile his recent announcement has again fuelled the sentiments, over the years, such bold statements have been used by influential names to sway the market. This event may not be any different. If such a reserve and stockpile are built, there could be a sharp rise in the prices of select coins, with the possibility of market manipulation as well. If big players can move prices with a single announcement or policy shift, it raises serious concerns about fair play.\n\nWithout strict supervision, those with insider knowledge could take advantage of these swings to cash in, while retail investors are likely to be caught off guard. For investors, this means additional risk and [volatility](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/volatility) because they could end up buying at inflated prices and suffer losses when the hype dies down and prices settle.\n\nTake the meme coin craze and the metaverse hype in 2021. Tech billionaire and a part of Trump’s team, Elon Musk, openly backed Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, triggering a massive bull run in both coins. Around the same time, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s talk about the metaverse sent coins like Decentraland’s MANA soaring. However, these fizzled out as quickly as they had shot up. Many investors who jumped in due to the fear of missing out incurred massive losses.\n\nAnish Bhilwara was one such investor. The 24-year-old entrepreneur invested all his savings worth Rs. 60,000 in Shiba Inu, Doge, Ripple, BitTorrent and Polymesh in 2021, giving in to the hype of meme coins. “I just wanted to prove myself to my family,” says Bhilwara, who ended up losing 85% of his investment. Hoping to recover his losses over time, Bhilwara stayed invested but lost again when [WazirX](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/wazirx) was hacked.\n\nThese are regular occurrences in the world of cryptocurrency, especially those who invest in hype-driven alt coins. Sunil Mahajan (name changed) faced a similar fate. The 45-year-old IT professional saw initial success by investing in Bitcoin, [Ethereum](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ethereum), and XRP. “These were long-term bets, and they worked well for me,” he says.\n\nWhen his friends started pouring money into meme coins, FOMO kicked in. Mahajan invested Rs.20 lakh across various coins. Today, they’re worth Rs.10 lakh. “I invested through WazirX, but now they are going to pay only 60% of the remaining amount (ET Wealth could not independently verify this claim) because it got hacked. I am never investing in crypto again,” says Mahajan, who invested to buy a Mercedes. “Now I can’t even buy a decent car,” he says wryly. Mahajan believes his mistake wasn’t in choosing Bitcoin or ETH, but in letting emotions drive his bets.\n\nThis is the reason the Indian government has consistently discouraged crypto investments. The RBI had banned trading in crypto in 2018, but the Supreme Court lifted it in 2020. Despite this, the government has tried to ward off enthusiastic investors by taxing crypto gains at 30% and not allowing losses from crypto trading to be set off against profits from other trading.\n\nThe 2025 budget has tightened the screws further. “Virtual digital assets, including cryptocurrencies and NFTs, are now categorised under undisclosed income, subjecting these to higher tax rates,” says Akshat Pande, Managing Partner, Alpha Partners.\n\n**Bitcoin volatility over the years**\n\nThe high volatility posed a risk for investors.\n\n![im1-](https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-42031747/et-logo.jpg)\n\n## What should you do?\n\nIn line with most experts’ opinion, ET Wealth doesn’t recommend investing in cryptos since it remains a high-risk option, and the US creating a reserve could add more uncertainty. “Crypto may not be a good investment idea unless there’s clarity on its overall regulatory acceptance,” cautions Rohit Shah, Founder and CEO, GYR Financial Planners. Until the regulatory landscape is clearer, investors would be better off restraining from cryptos.\n\nIf, however, you wish to experiment or are curious, stick to blue-chip coins. Though these, too, are volatile, they are cyclical in nature. If you end up losing money, you may earn it back if you stay invested for a long time. Other coins are sentiment-driven and more like a gamble. The top five blue-chip coins include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Solana, and Ripple. However, be careful of the amount you invest. No more than 2-5% of your portfolio should be allocated to crypto currency. Or only as much as you can afford to see go up in smoke.\n\n## Before you invest in crypto...\n\n_To minimise your losses, consider these tips while investing._\n\n_**Invest via fiu-ind platform**_\n\n_The registration with Financial Intelligence Unit, India, shows the exchange’s commitment to following the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) guidelines.

While this might signal an incoming crypto rally, do not ignore the market's inherent volatility and risks associated with hype-driven investments. Moreover, regulatory ambiguity around this asset class is another reason you should be careful while investing in this asset.\n\n![Should I invest in Bitcoin?](https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-119044145,width-300,height-225,imgsize-159732,resizemode-75/should-i-invest-in-bitcoin.jpg)Getty ImagesBefore investing in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, make sure to check the authenticity of the application you are using. Also, do not invest in coins that are merely driven by hype, and have no actual, real-world value.\n\nWith bears champing at the bit and dragging down the overall market sentiment, an unlikely spike has managed to lift a section of Indian investors. The recent announcement by US President [Donald Trump](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/panache/panache-people-101/donald-trump/profileshow/79057526.cms) to create a “strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital assets stockpile” has sent the [crypto](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency) enthusiasts in India into a tizzy. Hoping to cash in on what they believe could be the next big rally, they have led a surge in trading volumes, with CoinDCX reporting a 36% hike and Mudrex registering a 30% spike.\n\nIncome Tax Guide\n\n[Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/income-tax-slabs) [Income Tax Calculator 2025](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/calculators/income-tax-calculator) [New Income Tax Bill 2025](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/new-income-tax-bill-2025)\n\nWhile the reserve will only include Bitcoin, already owned by the US government, not acquired or actively bought, the digital asset stockpile will consist of tokens other than the Bitcoin—Ethereum (ETH), [Solana](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/solana) (SOL), [Ripple](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ripple) ( [XRP](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/xrp)), and [Cardano](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/cardano) (ADA), which will also not be acquired. The announcement is significant because it’s the first time that Bitcoin has been recognised as a reserve asset of the US government.\n\n“This sends a powerful message to the world about how blockchain and digital assets are becoming mainstream,” says Sumit Gupta, co-founder of CoinDCX. Agrees Edul Patel, Co-founder of Mudrex: “There is a strong future for crypto and Bitcoin globally, not just in the US.”\n\n## Chase hype, pay the price\n\nCryptocurrency is a sentiment-driven market, and its volatile nature is no secret. In fact, Trump’s earlier promise of such a reserve and ease of regulation had seen the token surge to an all-time high of $109,071.8 in January.\n\nWhile his recent announcement has again fuelled the sentiments, over the years, such bold statements have been used by influential names to sway the market. This event may not be any different. If such a reserve and stockpile are built, there could be a sharp rise in the prices of select coins, with the possibility of market manipulation as well. If big players can move prices with a single announcement or policy shift, it raises serious concerns about fair play.\n\nWithout strict supervision, those with insider knowledge could take advantage of these swings to cash in, while retail investors are likely to be caught off guard. For investors, this means additional risk and [volatility](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/volatility) because they could end up buying at inflated prices and suffer losses when the hype dies down and prices settle.\n\nTake the meme coin craze and the metaverse hype in 2021. Tech billionaire and a part of Trump’s team, Elon Musk, openly backed Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, triggering a massive bull run in both coins. Around the same time, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s talk about the metaverse sent coins like Decentraland’s MANA soaring. However, these fizzled out as quickly as they had shot up. Many investors who jumped in due to the fear of missing out incurred massive losses.\n\nAnish Bhilwara was one such investor. The 24-year-old entrepreneur invested all his savings worth Rs. 60,000 in Shiba Inu, Doge, Ripple, BitTorrent and Polymesh in 2021, giving in to the hype of meme coins. “I just wanted to prove myself to my family,” says Bhilwara, who ended up losing 85% of his investment. Hoping to recover his losses over time, Bhilwara stayed invested but lost again when [WazirX](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/wazirx) was hacked.\n\nThese are regular occurrences in the world of cryptocurrency, especially those who invest in hype-driven alt coins. Sunil Mahajan (name changed) faced a similar fate. The 45-year-old IT professional saw initial success by investing in Bitcoin, [Ethereum](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ethereum), and XRP. “These were long-term bets, and they worked well for me,” he says.\n\nWhen his friends started pouring money into meme coins, FOMO kicked in. Mahajan invested Rs.20 lakh across various coins. Today, they’re worth Rs.10 lakh. “I invested through WazirX, but now they are going to pay only 60% of the remaining amount (ET Wealth could not independently verify this claim) because it got hacked. I am never investing in crypto again,” says Mahajan, who invested to buy a Mercedes. “Now I can’t even buy a decent car,” he says wryly. Mahajan believes his mistake wasn’t in choosing Bitcoin or ETH, but in letting emotions drive his bets.\n\nThis is the reason the Indian government has consistently discouraged crypto investments. The RBI had banned trading in crypto in 2018, but the Supreme Court lifted it in 2020. Despite this, the government has tried to ward off enthusiastic investors by taxing crypto gains at 30% and not allowing losses from crypto trading to be set off against profits from other trading.\n\nThe 2025 budget has tightened the screws further. “Virtual digital assets, including cryptocurrencies and NFTs, are now categorised under undisclosed income, subjecting these to higher tax rates,” says Akshat Pande, Managing Partner, Alpha Partners.\n\n**Bitcoin volatility over the years**\n\nThe high volatility posed a risk for investors.\n\n![im1-](https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-42031747/et-logo.jpg)\n\n## What should you do?\n\nIn line with most experts’ opinion, ET Wealth doesn’t recommend investing in cryptos since it remains a high-risk option, and the US creating a reserve could add more uncertainty. “Crypto may not be a good investment idea unless there’s clarity on its overall regulatory acceptance,” cautions Rohit Shah, Founder and CEO, GYR Financial Planners. Until the regulatory landscape is clearer, investors would be better off restraining from cryptos.\n\nIf, however, you wish to experiment or are curious, stick to blue-chip coins. Though these, too, are volatile, they are cyclical in nature. If you end up losing money, you may earn it back if you stay invested for a long time. Other coins are sentiment-driven and more like a gamble. The top five blue-chip coins include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Solana, and Ripple. However, be careful of the amount you invest. No more than 2-5% of your portfolio should be allocated to crypto currency. Or only as much as you can afford to see go up in smoke.\n\n## Before you invest in crypto...\n\n_To minimise your losses, consider these tips while investing._\n\n_**Invest via fiu-ind platform**_\n\n_The registration with Financial Intelligence Unit, India, shows the exchange’s commitment to following the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) guidelines. Opt for compliant platforms to protect your assets._\n\n_**Beware of fake apps, websites**_\n\n_To avoid scams, verify the authenticity of a website or app and check if it is regulated by a reputable authority._\n\n_**Research & understand**_\n\n_Research the underlying technology, use case, and adoption potential of the coin. Do not fall for hype-driven coins that lack real-world utility._\n\n_**Have an investing cap**_\n\n_Avoid taking loans or using emergency funds; invest only the amount you can afford to lose. No more than 2-5% of your portfolio should be in cryptos._\n\n## View 1 Comments on this Story\n\n#### Read More News on\n\n[crypto](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency) [ethereum](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ethereum) [Solana](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/solana) [Ripple](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ripple) [Cardano](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/cardano) [Volatility](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/Volatility) [xrp](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/xrp) [Donald Trump](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/panache/panache-people-101/donald-trump/profileshow/79057526.cms) [WazirX](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/wazirx)\n\n(Catch all the [Personal Finance News](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/personal-finance), [Breaking News](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/breakingnewslist.cms), [Budget 2025](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/budget) Events and [Latest News](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/latest-news) Updates on [The Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/).)\n\nSubscribe to [ET Prime](https://buy.indiatimes.com/ET/plans) and read the [ET ePaper](https://epaper.indiatimes.com/timesepaper/publication-the-economic-times,city-delhi.cms) online.\n\n...moreless\n\n## Lessons from the Grandmasters\n\n- [![Masterclass Series on Sales](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1450_feature_image_1728907600_93797.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1450.cms)\n- [![Masterclass Series on Succession Planning](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1136_feature_image_1702538875_53694.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1136.cms)\n- [![Masterclass Series on Organisation Culture](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1135_feature_image_1728907989_73976.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1135.cms)\n- [![Masterclass Series on Scaling and Sustainability](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1134_feature_image_1702280587_61874.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1134.cms)\n- [![Masterclass Series on Managing Risk and Failure](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1117_feature_image_1701427714_66665.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1117.cms)\n- [![Masterclass Series on Customer Centricity](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1116_feature_image_1706621729_46159.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1116.cms)\n- [![Masterclass Series on Marketing](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1114_feature_image_1701346382_59023.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1114.cms)\n- [![Masterclass Series on Family Business](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1112_feature_image_1701258991_76488.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1112.cms)\n- [![Masterclass Series on Hiring & Retention](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1111_feature_image_1701257795_70788.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1111.cms)\n- [![Masterclass Series on Strategy and Innovation](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1036_feature_image_1691475912_54545.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1036.cms)\n- [![Masterclass on Brand Building](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1031_feature_image_1691149139_14706.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1031.cms)\n- [![Masterclass on FundRaising](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1030_feature_image_1690948731_52321.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1030.cms)\n- [![Masterclass Series on Leadership](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1029_feature_image_1692966934_52103.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1029.cms)\n- [![Masterclass on Entrepreneurship](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1028_feature_image_1690895884_52310.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1028.cms)\n\n[![The Economic Times](https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-74462387,quality-100/et-logo.jpg)![The Economic Times](https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-74451948,quality-100/et-logo.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/ \"The Economic Times\")\n\nEnter search text:\n\n[iframe](https://gum.criteo.com/syncframe?topUrl=economictimes.indiatimes.com&origin=onetag#{\"bundle\":{\"identifierExtractor\":{\"origin\":0},\"value\":null},\"cw\":true,\"optout\":{\"identifierExtractor\":{\"origin\":0},\"value\":null},\"origin\":\"onetag\",\"tld\":\"indiatimes.com\",\"topUrl\":\"economictimes.indiatimes.com\",\"version\":\"5_35_0\",\"ifa\":{\"identifierExtractor\":{\"origin\":0},\"value\":null},\"lsw\":true,\"pm\":0})\n\nFind this comment offensive?\n\nChoose your reason below and click on the Report button.

While this might signal an incoming crypto rally, do not ignore the market's inherent volatility and risks associated with hype-driven investments. Moreover, regulatory ambiguity around this asset class is another reason you should be careful while investing in this asset.\n\n![Should I invest in Bitcoin?](https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-119044145,width-300,height-225,imgsize-159732,resizemode-75/should-i-invest-in-bitcoin.jpg)Getty ImagesBefore investing in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, make sure to check the authenticity of the application you are using. Also, do not invest in coins that are merely driven by hype, and have no actual, real-world value.\n\nWith bears champing at the bit and dragging down the overall market sentiment, an unlikely spike has managed to lift a section of Indian investors. The recent announcement by US President [Donald Trump](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/panache/panache-people-101/donald-trump/profileshow/79057526.cms) to create a “strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital assets stockpile” has sent the [crypto](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency) enthusiasts in India into a tizzy. Hoping to cash in on what they believe could be the next big rally, they have led a surge in trading volumes, with CoinDCX reporting a 36% hike and Mudrex registering a 30% spike.\n\nIncome Tax Guide\n\n[Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/income-tax-slabs) [Income Tax Calculator 2025](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/calculators/income-tax-calculator) [New Income Tax Bill 2025](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/new-income-tax-bill-2025)\n\nWhile the reserve will only include Bitcoin, already owned by the US government, not acquired or actively bought, the digital asset stockpile will consist of tokens other than the Bitcoin—Ethereum (ETH), [Solana](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/solana) (SOL), [Ripple](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ripple) ( [XRP](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/xrp)), and [Cardano](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/cardano) (ADA), which will also not be acquired. The announcement is significant because it’s the first time that Bitcoin has been recognised as a reserve asset of the US government.\n\n“This sends a powerful message to the world about how blockchain and digital assets are becoming mainstream,” says Sumit Gupta, co-founder of CoinDCX. Agrees Edul Patel, Co-founder of Mudrex: “There is a strong future for crypto and Bitcoin globally, not just in the US.”\n\n## Chase hype, pay the price\n\nCryptocurrency is a sentiment-driven market, and its volatile nature is no secret. In fact, Trump’s earlier promise of such a reserve and ease of regulation had seen the token surge to an all-time high of $109,071.8 in January.\n\nWhile his recent announcement has again fuelled the sentiments, over the years, such bold statements have been used by influential names to sway the market. This event may not be any different. If such a reserve and stockpile are built, there could be a sharp rise in the prices of select coins, with the possibility of market manipulation as well. If big players can move prices with a single announcement or policy shift, it raises serious concerns about fair play.\n\nWithout strict supervision, those with insider knowledge could take advantage of these swings to cash in, while retail investors are likely to be caught off guard. For investors, this means additional risk and [volatility](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/volatility) because they could end up buying at inflated prices and suffer losses when the hype dies down and prices settle.\n\nTake the meme coin craze and the metaverse hype in 2021. Tech billionaire and a part of Trump’s team, Elon Musk, openly backed Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, triggering a massive bull run in both coins. Around the same time, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s talk about the metaverse sent coins like Decentraland’s MANA soaring. However, these fizzled out as quickly as they had shot up. Many investors who jumped in due to the fear of missing out incurred massive losses.\n\nAnish Bhilwara was one such investor. The 24-year-old entrepreneur invested all his savings worth Rs. 60,000 in Shiba Inu, Doge, Ripple, BitTorrent and Polymesh in 2021, giving in to the hype of meme coins. “I just wanted to prove myself to my family,” says Bhilwara, who ended up losing 85% of his investment. Hoping to recover his losses over time, Bhilwara stayed invested but lost again when [WazirX](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/wazirx) was hacked.\n\nThese are regular occurrences in the world of cryptocurrency, especially those who invest in hype-driven alt coins. Sunil Mahajan (name changed) faced a similar fate. The 45-year-old IT professional saw initial success by investing in Bitcoin, [Ethereum](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ethereum), and XRP. “These were long-term bets, and they worked well for me,” he says.\n\nWhen his friends started pouring money into meme coins, FOMO kicked in. Mahajan invested Rs.20 lakh across various coins. Today, they’re worth Rs.10 lakh. “I invested through WazirX, but now they are going to pay only 60% of the remaining amount (ET Wealth could not independently verify this claim) because it got hacked. I am never investing in crypto again,” says Mahajan, who invested to buy a Mercedes. “Now I can’t even buy a decent car,” he says wryly. Mahajan believes his mistake wasn’t in choosing Bitcoin or ETH, but in letting emotions drive his bets.\n\nThis is the reason the Indian government has consistently discouraged crypto investments. The RBI had banned trading in crypto in 2018, but the Supreme Court lifted it in 2020. Despite this, the government has tried to ward off enthusiastic investors by taxing crypto gains at 30% and not allowing losses from crypto trading to be set off against profits from other trading.\n\nThe 2025 budget has tightened the screws further. “Virtual digital assets, including cryptocurrencies and NFTs, are now categorised under undisclosed income, subjecting these to higher tax rates,” says Akshat Pande, Managing Partner, Alpha Partners.\n\n**Bitcoin volatility over the years**\n\nThe high volatility posed a risk for investors.\n\n![im1-](https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-42031747/et-logo.jpg)\n\n## What should you do?\n\nIn line with most experts’ opinion, ET Wealth doesn’t recommend investing in cryptos since it remains a high-risk option, and the US creating a reserve could add more uncertainty. “Crypto may not be a good investment idea unless there’s clarity on its overall regulatory acceptance,” cautions Rohit Shah, Founder and CEO, GYR Financial Planners. Until the regulatory landscape is clearer, investors would be better off restraining from cryptos.\n\nIf, however, you wish to experiment or are curious, stick to blue-chip coins. Though these, too, are volatile, they are cyclical in nature. If you end up losing money, you may earn it back if you stay invested for a long time. Other coins are sentiment-driven and more like a gamble. The top five blue-chip coins include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Solana, and Ripple. However, be careful of the amount you invest. No more than 2-5% of your portfolio should be allocated to crypto currency. Or only as much as you can afford to see go up in smoke.\n\n## Before you invest in crypto...\n\n_To minimise your losses, consider these tips while investing._\n\n_**Invest via fiu-ind platform**_\n\n_The registration with Financial Intelligence Unit, India, shows the exchange’s commitment to following the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) guidelines. Opt for compliant platforms to protect your assets._\n\n_**Beware of fake apps, websites**_\n\n_To avoid scams, verify the authenticity of a website or app and check if it is regulated by a reputable authority._\n\n_**Research & understand**_\n\n_Research the underlying technology, use case, and adoption potential of the coin. Do not fall for hype-driven coins that lack real-world utility._\n\n_**Have an investing cap**_\n\n_Avoid taking loans or using emergency funds; invest only the amount you can afford to lose. No more than 2-5% of your portfolio should be in cryptos._\n\n## View 1 Comments on this Story\n\n#### Read More News on\n\n[crypto](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency) [ethereum](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ethereum) [Solana](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/solana) [Ripple](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ripple) [Cardano](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/cardano) [Volatility](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/Volatility) [xrp](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/xrp) [Donald Trump](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/panache/panache-people-101/donald-trump/profileshow/79057526.cms) [WazirX](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/wazirx)\n\n(Catch all the [Personal Finance News](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/personal-finance), [Breaking News](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/breakingnewslist.cms), [Budget 2025](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/budget) Events and [Latest News](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/latest-news) Updates on [The Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/).)\n\nSubscribe to [ET Prime](https://buy.indiatimes.com/ET/plans) and read the [ET ePaper](https://epaper.indiatimes.com/timesepaper/publication-the-economic-times,city-delhi.cms) online.\n\n...moreless\n\n## Lessons from the Grandmasters\n\n- [![Masterclass Series on Sales](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1450_feature_image_1728907600_93797.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1450.cms)\n- [![Masterclass Series on Succession Planning](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1136_feature_image_1702538875_53694.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1136.cms)\n- [![Masterclass Series on Organisation Culture](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1135_feature_image_1728907989_73976.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1135.cms)\n- [![Masterclass Series on Scaling and Sustainability](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1134_feature_image_1702280587_61874.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1134.cms)\n- [![Masterclass Series on Managing Risk and Failure](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1117_feature_image_1701427714_66665.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1117.cms)\n- [![Masterclass Series on Customer Centricity](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1116_feature_image_1706621729_46159.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1116.cms)\n- [![Masterclass Series on Marketing](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1114_feature_image_1701346382_59023.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1114.cms)\n- [![Masterclass Series on Family Business](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1112_feature_image_1701258991_76488.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1112.cms)\n- [![Masterclass Series on Hiring & Retention](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1111_feature_image_1701257795_70788.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1111.cms)\n- [![Masterclass Series on Strategy and Innovation](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1036_feature_image_1691475912_54545.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1036.cms)\n- [![Masterclass on Brand Building](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1031_feature_image_1691149139_14706.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1031.cms)\n- [![Masterclass on FundRaising](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1030_feature_image_1690948731_52321.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1030.cms)\n- [![Masterclass Series on Leadership](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1029_feature_image_1692966934_52103.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1029.cms)\n- [![Masterclass on Entrepreneurship](https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1028_feature_image_1690895884_52310.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etgrandmasters/id-1028.cms)\n\n[![The Economic Times](https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-74462387,quality-100/et-logo.jpg)![The Economic Times](https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-74451948,quality-100/et-logo.jpg)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/ \"The Economic Times\")\n\nEnter search text:\n\n[iframe](https://gum.criteo.com/syncframe?topUrl=economictimes.indiatimes.com&origin=onetag#{\"bundle\":{\"identifierExtractor\":{\"origin\":0},\"value\":null},\"cw\":true,\"optout\":{\"identifierExtractor\":{\"origin\":0},\"value\":null},\"origin\":\"onetag\",\"tld\":\"indiatimes.com\",\"topUrl\":\"economictimes.indiatimes.com\",\"version\":\"5_35_0\",\"ifa\":{\"identifierExtractor\":{\"origin\":0},\"value\":null},\"lsw\":true,\"pm\":0})\n\nFind this comment offensive?\n\nChoose your reason below and click on the Report button.

Here’s an example:\n\n- Suppose Bitcoin is priced at $100,000, and a trader opens a 1 BTC long position using 100x leverage.\n- The actual trading position would be equivalent to 100 BTC.\n- If Bitcoin rises to $105,000, the profit calculation would be:\n\n(105,000 - 100,000) \\* 100 BTC / 100,000 = 5 BTC, resulting in a 500% return.\n\n\nWith **BexBack’s 100% deposit bonus**, traders can amplify their profits even further:\n\n![Double the funds](https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/11c50d01-06c4-447c-8540-388c08c9f483/double-the-funds.png)[Expand](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/03/18/3044689/0/en/BexBack-Launches-Double-Deposit-Bonus-50-Welcome-Bonus-and-100x-Leverage-Crypto-Trading-No-KYC.html# \"Expand\")\n\n- If the initial deposit is 2 BTC, the bonus doubles it to 4 BTC.\n- Under the same scenario, the profit would increase to 10 BTC, making the return on investment an impressive 1000%.\n\nIt is important to note that while leverage increases profit potential, it also comes with the risk of liquidation, so risk management is essential.\n\n**How Does the 100% Deposit Bonus Work?**\n\nBexBack’s [**100% deposit bonus**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Sd63ESRVAAv_9xtjPX_EKFxFCDuTHaOIDn820dRk-AIBRU4yEEbHjVYA7BtLU8ZzNMXPehpJvmpkMtZJA7qU_1S8laZbuC5Rly82t6CJ23M3UdtqBT5bFBvn-vwsHS9fiZE1Q6CO76iQacb95l-sd8YFo11podEoAv-Bck02FCEHdp5qESnHyCMMbc8ADXTfW3BSLEr1TiVKXVKt0-WdDg== \"\") cannot be directly withdrawn but can be used to open larger trading positions and increase profit potential. During times of significant market fluctuations, the bonus can also serve as **additional margin**, helping reduce the risk of liquidation.\n\n**About BexBack**\n\n[**BexBack**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=T1fcrL6D4oz9hJo1PBGs1EDQMoAdCK9M1jDR8tLaDojaZebpANCV6aGmSRKQgNBa72F-Y89bSRaL2szrv_9I23sfkICtji2fJr_bQfMDTPuZ-OCENP-RJ_nOQOC_reIvGX633p2T6VcYZ0lBUP0Ucos74ug6MxyLM5FGTViT0Dc= \"\") is a leading cryptocurrency derivatives platform offering 100x leverage on BTC, ETH, ADA, SOL, and XRP futures contracts.

This decision drove Bitcoin's price above $94,000, while Ethereum and other major altcoins saw substantial gains followed by sharp declines, reaffirming the market's continued short-term turbulence.\n\nAs a result, analysts predict that the cryptocurrency market will continue to experience fluctuations. In such a scenario, holding spot positions alone may not be enough to generate short-term profits. Consequently, [**100x leverage futures trading**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=DnUrVB-FNAWmArHx15hHMcLwun6xL9cwv020VuQPuVe9FhzIaINElv0mhXGLZrgiB46gbGL4XOmMpZejcQKaAiUGwpVEfBKJiKFW9DzgRGopWYwRyzrCUC9eVCv2U7wV7YBvEZRTsJv_s5SACtGzsgqPc5BDme9tgrDQKrCIwH3uRZMa17fL6jnct44aM0Ls \"\") has become the preferred tool for experienced investors looking to maximize their returns from market volatility. To meet this growing demand, [**BexBack Exchange**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=T1fcrL6D4oz9hJo1PBGs1N0k6B5RQFUceLn0A4p03sD-PfJ9OQR5GtOwuVsxDtbt20YDoVseEm_P5ZFo2r_mvTvArEkT9x5tMRohkl2fuEQCjGxcmj79e3TMecsZV-ykbSzQ8ZYRvJ8Ll9WTl7qvTJtUFLJ_8FBBJNZKb6wSldw= \"\") is offering unparalleled promotional incentives, including:\n\n- [**100% Deposit Bonus**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=cKTzvJbzvaWYnhq-LkSpM8wEvxr6SpuNNaHZX9PkOWPI1EIGML4ZJ2QmuugnN943cNyBkF5kopDmprmotonbByWCydMJMvNX415fM64RxCO80VmEMaEYnpR0Zx_08tQp_aTlYHDH9lAYRBxkQvwwAom3eJ49zvTwrkVMXgSq_C91JiK1f-_4EH37_RdsL-Gcxuf5Ux2CwS4ifGp5IndwVDlrvAGGd_GfwVhx7GaQ2Q4= \"\") – Double your funds instantly.\n- $50 Welcome Bonus – Available for new users upon completing their first trade.\n- 100x Leverage on Crypto Trading – Maximize potential gains even in a volatile market.\n- No KYC Required – Start trading immediately without identity verification.\n\n**What Is 100x Leverage and How Does It Work?**\n\n100x leverage allows traders to open significantly larger positions with a small amount of capital. Here’s an example:\n\n- Suppose Bitcoin is priced at $100,000, and a trader opens a 1 BTC long position using 100x leverage.\n- The actual trading position would be equivalent to 100 BTC.\n- If Bitcoin rises to $105,000, the profit calculation would be:\n\n(105,000 - 100,000) \\* 100 BTC / 100,000 = 5 BTC, resulting in a 500% return.\n\n\nWith **BexBack’s 100% deposit bonus**, traders can amplify their profits even further:\n\n![Double the funds](https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/11c50d01-06c4-447c-8540-388c08c9f483/double-the-funds.png)[Expand](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/03/18/3044689/0/en/BexBack-Launches-Double-Deposit-Bonus-50-Welcome-Bonus-and-100x-Leverage-Crypto-Trading-No-KYC.html# \"Expand\")\n\n- If the initial deposit is 2 BTC, the bonus doubles it to 4 BTC.\n- Under the same scenario, the profit would increase to 10 BTC, making the return on investment an impressive 1000%.\n\nIt is important to note that while leverage increases profit potential, it also comes with the risk of liquidation, so risk management is essential.\n\n**How Does the 100% Deposit Bonus Work?**\n\nBexBack’s [**100% deposit bonus**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Sd63ESRVAAv_9xtjPX_EKFxFCDuTHaOIDn820dRk-AIBRU4yEEbHjVYA7BtLU8ZzNMXPehpJvmpkMtZJA7qU_1S8laZbuC5Rly82t6CJ23M3UdtqBT5bFBvn-vwsHS9fiZE1Q6CO76iQacb95l-sd8YFo11podEoAv-Bck02FCEHdp5qESnHyCMMbc8ADXTfW3BSLEr1TiVKXVKt0-WdDg== \"\") cannot be directly withdrawn but can be used to open larger trading positions and increase profit potential. During times of significant market fluctuations, the bonus can also serve as **additional margin**, helping reduce the risk of liquidation.\n\n**About BexBack**\n\n[**BexBack**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=T1fcrL6D4oz9hJo1PBGs1EDQMoAdCK9M1jDR8tLaDojaZebpANCV6aGmSRKQgNBa72F-Y89bSRaL2szrv_9I23sfkICtji2fJr_bQfMDTPuZ-OCENP-RJ_nOQOC_reIvGX633p2T6VcYZ0lBUP0Ucos74ug6MxyLM5FGTViT0Dc= \"\") is a leading cryptocurrency derivatives platform offering 100x leverage on BTC, ETH, ADA, SOL, and XRP futures contracts.

This decision drove Bitcoin's price above $94,000, while Ethereum and other major altcoins saw substantial gains followed by sharp declines, reaffirming the market's continued short-term turbulence.\n\nAs a result, analysts predict that the cryptocurrency market will continue to experience fluctuations. In such a scenario, holding spot positions alone may not be enough to generate short-term profits. Consequently, [**100x leverage futures trading**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=DnUrVB-FNAWmArHx15hHMcLwun6xL9cwv020VuQPuVe9FhzIaINElv0mhXGLZrgiB46gbGL4XOmMpZejcQKaAiUGwpVEfBKJiKFW9DzgRGopWYwRyzrCUC9eVCv2U7wV7YBvEZRTsJv_s5SACtGzsgqPc5BDme9tgrDQKrCIwH3uRZMa17fL6jnct44aM0Ls \"\") has become the preferred tool for experienced investors looking to maximize their returns from market volatility.

Here’s an example:\n\n- Suppose Bitcoin is priced at $100,000, and a trader opens a 1 BTC long position using 100x leverage.\n- The actual trading position would be equivalent to 100 BTC.\n- If Bitcoin rises to $105,000, the profit calculation would be:\n\n(105,000 - 100,000) \\* 100 BTC / 100,000 = 5 BTC, resulting in a 500% return.\n\n\nWith **BexBack’s 100% deposit bonus**, traders can amplify their profits even further:\n\n![Double the funds](https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/11c50d01-06c4-447c-8540-388c08c9f483/double-the-funds.png)[Expand](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/03/18/3044689/0/en/BexBack-Launches-Double-Deposit-Bonus-50-Welcome-Bonus-and-100x-Leverage-Crypto-Trading-No-KYC.html# \"Expand\")\n\n- If the initial deposit is 2 BTC, the bonus doubles it to 4 BTC.\n- Under the same scenario, the profit would increase to 10 BTC, making the return on investment an impressive 1000%.\n\nIt is important to note that while leverage increases profit potential, it also comes with the risk of liquidation, so risk management is essential.\n\n**How Does the 100% Deposit Bonus Work?**\n\nBexBack’s [**100% deposit bonus**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Sd63ESRVAAv_9xtjPX_EKFxFCDuTHaOIDn820dRk-AIBRU4yEEbHjVYA7BtLU8ZzNMXPehpJvmpkMtZJA7qU_1S8laZbuC5Rly82t6CJ23M3UdtqBT5bFBvn-vwsHS9fiZE1Q6CO76iQacb95l-sd8YFo11podEoAv-Bck02FCEHdp5qESnHyCMMbc8ADXTfW3BSLEr1TiVKXVKt0-WdDg== \"\") cannot be directly withdrawn but can be used to open larger trading positions and increase profit potential.
