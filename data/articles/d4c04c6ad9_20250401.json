Bitcoin (BTC)\n\n- **Market cap: $1.7 trillion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 31%**\n\nCreated in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, [bitcoin](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-bitcoin/) (BTC) is the original cryptocurrency. As with most cryptocurrencies, BTC runs on a [blockchain](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2020/05/18/what-is-the-blockchain-and-why-does-it-matter/), or a ledger logging transactions distributed across a network of thousands of computers. Because additions to the distributed ledgers must be verified by solving a cryptographic puzzle, a process called proof of work, bitcoin is kept secure and safe from fraudsters.\n\nBitcoin’s price has skyrocketed as it’s become a household name. In May 2016, you could buy one bitcoin for about $500. As of Mar. 25, 2025, a single bitcoin’s price was around $87,702. That’s a growth of 17,440%.\n\n**Related:** [How To Buy Bitcoin](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/how-to-buy-bitcoin/)\n\n### 2\\. Ethereum (ETH)\n\n- **Market cap: $250.1 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: -40%**\n\nBoth a cryptocurrency and a blockchain platform, [Ethereum](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-ethereum-ether/) is a favorite of program developers because of its potential applications, like so-called smart contracts that automatically execute when conditions are met and non-fungible tokens ([NFTs](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/nft-non-fungible-token/)).\n\nEthereum has also experienced tremendous growth. From April 2016 to the end of March 2025, its price went from about $11 to around $2,073, increasing 18,743%.\n\n**Related:** [How To Buy Ethereum](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/how-to-buy-ethereum/)\n\n### 3\\. Tether (USDT)\n\n- **Market cap: $143.8 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 2,025-03-25T13:31:38.866Z%**\n\nUnlike some other forms of cryptocurrency, [Tether](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-tether-usdt/) (USDT) is a stablecoin, meaning it’s backed by fiat currencies like U.S. dollars and the Euro and hypothetically keeps a value equal to one of those denominations. In theory, this means Tether’s value is supposed to be more consistent than other cryptocurrencies, and it’s favored by investors who are wary of the extreme volatility of other coins.\n\n### 4\\. XRP (XRP)\n\n- **Market cap: $142.5 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 2,025-03-25T13:31:38.877Z%**\n\nCreated by some of the same founders as [Ripple](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-ripple-xrp/), a digital technology and payment processing company, XRP can be used on that network to facilitate exchanges of different currency types, including fiat currencies and other major cryptocurrencies.\n\nAt the beginning of 2017, the price of XRP was $0.006. As of Mar. 25, 2025, its price reached $2.45, equal to a rise of 40,723%.\n\n### 5\\. Binance Coin (BNB)\n\n- **Market cap: $90.3 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 10%**\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) is a form of cryptocurrency that you can use to trade and pay fees on [Binance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/binance-us-review/), one of the largest [crypto exchanges](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/best-crypto-exchanges/) in the world. Since its launch in 2017, Binance Coin has expanded past merely facilitating trades on Binance’s exchange platform. Now, it can be used for trading, payment processing or even booking travel arrangements. It can also be traded or exchanged for other forms of cryptocurrency, such as Ethereum or bitcoin.\n\nBNB’s price in 2017 was just $0.10. By late March 2025, its price had risen to around $634, a gain of 633,728%.\n\n**Related:** [How To Buy Cryptocurrency](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/how-to-buy-cryptocurrency/)\n\n### 6\\. Solana (SOL)\n\n- **Market cap: $73.9 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 2,025-03-25T13:31:38.663Z%**\n\nDeveloped to help power decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/defi-decentralized-finance/)) uses, decentralized apps (DApps) and smart contracts, Solana runs on a unique hybrid proof-of-stake and proof-of-history mechanisms to process transactions quickly and securely. SOL, Solana’s native token, powers the platform.\n\nWhen it launched in 2020, SOL’s price started at $0.77. By late March 2025, its price was around $144.53, a gain of 18,671%.\n\n### 7\\. U.S. Dollar Coin (USDC)\n\n- **Market cap: $59.8 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 2,025-03-25T13:31:38.853Z%**\n\nLike Tether, [USD Coin](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/usd-coin/) (USDC) is a stablecoin, meaning it’s backed by U.S. dollars and aims for a 1 USD to 1 USDC ratio. USDC is powered by Ethereum, and you can use USD Coin to complete global transactions.\n\n### 8\\. Dogecoin (DOGE)\n\n- **Market cap: $27.9 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 10%**\n\n[Dogecoin](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-dogecoin/) was famously started as a joke in 2013 but rapidly evolved into a prominent cryptocurrency thanks to a dedicated community and creative memes. Unlike many other cryptos, there is no limit on the number of Dogecoins that can be created, which leaves the currency susceptible to devaluation as supply increases.\n\nDogecoin’s price in 2017 was $0.0002. By March 2025, its price was at $0.19, up 93,745%.\n\n### 9\\. Cardano (ADA)\n\n- **Market cap: $26.7 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 18%**\n\nSomewhat later to the crypto scene, [Cardano](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/cardano-ada/) (ADA) is notable for its early embrace of proof-of-stake validation. This method expedites transaction time and [decreases energy usage](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/bitcoins-energy-usage-explained/) and environmental impact by removing the competitive, problem-solving aspect of transaction verification in platforms like bitcoin. Cardano also works like Ethereum to enable smart contracts and decentralized applications, which ADA, its native coin, powers.\n\nCardano’s ADA token has had relatively modest growth compared to other major crypto coins. In 2017, ADA’s price was $0.02. As of Mar. 25, 2025, its price was $0.76. This is an increase of 3,683%.\n\n### 10\\. TRON (TRX)\n\n- **Market cap: $21.6 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 2,025-03-25T13:31:38.838Z%**\n\nMuch like Solana, TRON is a blockchain designed to run smart contracts and other DeFi applications. TRX is the platform’s native cryptocurrency, which powers its proof-of-stake consensus algorithm.\n\nTRON was founded in 2017, and TRX was initially valued at $0.0019 per token. At its peak in 2018, TRX spiked as high as $0.2245, for a gain of 11,715% in a matter of months. TRX is currently valued around $0.23.\n\n_\\*Market caps and pricing sourced from coinmarketcap.com, current as of 8:31 a.m. UTC on Mar. 25, 2025._\n\n## What Are Cryptocurrencies?\n\n[Cryptocurrency](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-cryptocurrency/) is a form of currency that exists solely in digital form. Cryptocurrency can be used to pay for purchases online without going through an intermediary, such as a bank, or it can be held as an investment.\n\n### How Does Cryptocurrency Work?\n\nCryptocurrencies are various forms of digital money that are usually based on blockchain technology. Blockchain technology allows most cryptocurrencies to exist as “trustless” forms of transactions. This means there is no centralized authority overseeing the transactions on a cryptocurrency’s blockchain.\n\n### Why Are There So Many Cryptocurrencies?\n\nCryptocurrency is an emerging area with more than 9,000 crypto projects in existence as of March 2024.\n\nWhile some crypto function as currencies, others are used to develop infrastructure. For instance, in the case of Ethereum or Solana, developers are building other cryptos on top of these platform currencies, and that creates even more possibilities (and cryptos).\n\n## Pros and Cons of Cryptocurrency\n\nThere are both pros and cons to investing in cryptocurrencies. Some of the most common ones an investor might run into are:\n\n| Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Decentralization | High energy usage associated with mining |\n| Accessibility | Evolving government regulations |\n| Potentially high returns | Price volatility |\n| Transaction speed | Prevalence of scams and fraud |\n\n![Left Arrow](<Base64-Image-Removed>)![Right Arrow](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nSee MoreSee Less\n\n## How To Choose the Best Crypto To Invest In\n\nWhen choosing the best cryptocurrency to invest in, it is important to consider your individual goals, investing timeline and risk profile, just as you would with any investment. Additionally, you should do your due diligence to make sure that any crypto project you are interested in is legitimate and secure.\n\nIn general, investors should consider the following when evaluating a crypto:\n\n- Market capitalization\n- Liquidity\n- Security\n- Use case\n\nWhen exploring cryptocurrency investments, first consider the exchanges where the token is listed. Tokens featured on major exchanges generally offer better liquidity, attracting larger investors and reaching a broader audience, which in turn increases the potential buyer base.\n\n_– Maksym Repa, analyst at Symbolic Capital_\n\n## How To Invest in Cryptocurrency?\n\nYou can buy cryptocurrencies through crypto exchanges, such as [Coinbase](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/coinbase-review/), [Kraken](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/kraken-review/) or [Gemini](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/gemini-review/). In addition, some brokerages, such as WeBull and Robinhood, also allow consumers to buy cryptocurrencies.\n\n## How Much Does It Cost To Buy Cryptocurrency?\n\nHow much it costs to buy cryptocurrency depends on a number of factors, including which crypto you are buying. Many small altcoins trade for a fraction of a cent, while a single bitcoin will cost you tens of thousands of dollars. However, many brokerages and exchanges now allow fractional trading, offering investors the option to buy a portion of a cryptocurrency.\n\nThere are also often costs and fees associated with having a crypto wallet and/or an account on a brokerage or crypto exchange. Be sure that you understand all of the costs associated with buying and holding any cryptocurrency before you invest.\n\n## How To Report Crypto on Taxes\n\nIf you buy and sell coins, it’s important to pay attention to [cryptocurrency tax rules](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/taxes/what-are-cryptocurrency-taxes/).\n\nCryptocurrency is treated as a capital asset, like stocks, rather than cash. That means if you sell cryptocurrency at a profit, you’ll have to pay [capital gains taxes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/taxes/capital-gains-tax/). This is the case even if you use your crypto to pay for a purchase. If you receive a greater value for it than you paid, you’ll owe taxes on the difference.\n\nIs Robinhood Right For You?\n\n\nLearn more about Robinhood's Trading App\n\n[Learn More](https://www.myfinance.com/reporting/redir?redir=https%3A%2F%2Foc.brcclx.com%2Ft%2F%3Flid%3D26679471%26tid%3D%7Bsub_id%7D&utm_campaign=forbes-robinhood-invest-spl&sub_id=FAmXB7hhFDl63BgJxEUJcl_FwT9Cjjg0YB0)\n\nVia Robinhood's secure website\n\n## Crypto Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n### How does trading cryptocurrencies differ from trading stocks?\n\nWhile you can invest in cryptocurrencies, they differ a great deal from traditional investments, like stocks. When you buy stock, you are buying a share of ownership of a company, which means you’re entitled to do things like vote on the direction of the company. If that company goes bankrupt, you also may receive some compensation once its creditors have been paid from its liquidated assets.\n\nBuying cryptocurrency doesn’t grant you ownership over anything except the token itself; it’s more like exchanging one form of currency for another. If the crypto loses its value, you won’t receive anything after the fact.\n\nThere are several other key differences to keep in mind:\n\n- **Trading hours:** Stocks are only traded during stock exchange hours, typically 9:30 am to 4:30 pm ET, Monday through Friday. Cryptocurrency markets never close, so you can trade 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n- **Regulation:** Stocks are regulated financial products, meaning a governing body verifies their credentials and their finances are matters of public record. By contrast, cryptocurrencies are not regulated investment vehicles, so you may not be aware of the inner dynamics of your crypto or the developers working on it.\n- **Volatility:** Both stocks and cryptocurrency involve risk; the money you invest can lose value. However, stocks are directly linked to companies and generally rise and fall based on those companies’ performance. Cryptocurrency prices are more speculative—no one is quite sure of their value yet. That makes them much more volatile and affected by something as small as a celebrity’s tweet.\n\n### Are there cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds?\n\nGiven the thousands of cryptocurrencies in existence and the high volatility associated with most of them, it’s understandable you might want to take a [diversified](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-diversification/) approach to investing in crypto to minimize the risk that you might lose money.\n\nThere are [exchange-traded funds](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-are-etfs/), or ETFs, that trade in both bitcoin futures and bitcoin’s spot price. The [bitcoin ETF](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/best-bitcoin-etfs/) that is right for you, however, depends upon many factors, including your risk tolerance and investment horizon.\n\n### What are altcoins?\n\nWhen we first think of crypto, we usually think of bitcoin. That’s because bitcoin represents more than 45% of the total cryptocurrency market. So when we talk about any cryptos outside of bitcoin, all of those cryptos are considered altcoins.\n\nEthereum, for instance, is regarded as the most popular altcoin.\n\n### Why is bitcoin valuable?\n\nPart of what makes bitcoin so valuable is its scarcity. Bitcoin’s maximum supply is limited to 21 million coins. Currently, there are 19 million coins in circulation.\n\nTo create supply, bitcoin rewards [crypto miners](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/best-bitcoin-mining-software/) with a set bitcoin amount. To be exact, 6.25 BTC is issued when a miner has successfully mined a single block. To keep the process in check, the rewards given for mining bitcoin are cut in half almost every four years.\n\n### Why are cryptocurrencies important?\n\nWhile the initial premise of cryptocurrency was to fix the problems with traditional currencies, there are now a whole host of utility cryptocurrencies that have sprung up, thanks to the creation of the blockchain.\n\nWas this article helpful?\n\nShare your feedback\n\nSend feedback to the editorial team\n\nRate this Article\n\n★★★★★\n\nPlease rate the article\n\nEmail\n\nPlease enter valid email address\n\nComments\n\nWe'd love to hear from you, please enter your comments.\n\nInvalid email address\n\nSubmit\n\nThis form is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprise and the Google\n[Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and\n[Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) apply.\n\n\n![User Form](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/themes/fadv/assets/img/user-feedback-form/user-form-icon.svg)\n\n![Success Icon](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/themes/fadv/assets/img/user-feedback-form/success-icon.svg)\n\nThank You for your feedback!\n\n![Error Icon](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/themes/fadv/assets/img/user-feedback-form/error-icon.svg)\n\nSomething went wrong.

Bitcoin (BTC)\n\n- **Market cap: $1.7 trillion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 31%**\n\nCreated in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, [bitcoin](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-bitcoin/) (BTC) is the original cryptocurrency. As with most cryptocurrencies, BTC runs on a [blockchain](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2020/05/18/what-is-the-blockchain-and-why-does-it-matter/), or a ledger logging transactions distributed across a network of thousands of computers. Because additions to the distributed ledgers must be verified by solving a cryptographic puzzle, a process called proof of work, bitcoin is kept secure and safe from fraudsters.\n\nBitcoin’s price has skyrocketed as it’s become a household name. In May 2016, you could buy one bitcoin for about $500. As of Mar. 25, 2025, a single bitcoin’s price was around $87,702. That’s a growth of 17,440%.\n\n**Related:** [How To Buy Bitcoin](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/how-to-buy-bitcoin/)\n\n### 2\\. Ethereum (ETH)\n\n- **Market cap: $250.1 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: -40%**\n\nBoth a cryptocurrency and a blockchain platform, [Ethereum](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-ethereum-ether/) is a favorite of program developers because of its potential applications, like so-called smart contracts that automatically execute when conditions are met and non-fungible tokens ([NFTs](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/nft-non-fungible-token/)).\n\nEthereum has also experienced tremendous growth. From April 2016 to the end of March 2025, its price went from about $11 to around $2,073, increasing 18,743%.\n\n**Related:** [How To Buy Ethereum](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/how-to-buy-ethereum/)\n\n### 3\\. Tether (USDT)\n\n- **Market cap: $143.8 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 2,025-03-25T13:31:38.866Z%**\n\nUnlike some other forms of cryptocurrency, [Tether](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-tether-usdt/) (USDT) is a stablecoin, meaning it’s backed by fiat currencies like U.S. dollars and the Euro and hypothetically keeps a value equal to one of those denominations. In theory, this means Tether’s value is supposed to be more consistent than other cryptocurrencies, and it’s favored by investors who are wary of the extreme volatility of other coins.\n\n### 4\\. XRP (XRP)\n\n- **Market cap: $142.5 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 2,025-03-25T13:31:38.877Z%**\n\nCreated by some of the same founders as [Ripple](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-ripple-xrp/), a digital technology and payment processing company, XRP can be used on that network to facilitate exchanges of different currency types, including fiat currencies and other major cryptocurrencies.\n\nAt the beginning of 2017, the price of XRP was $0.006. As of Mar. 25, 2025, its price reached $2.45, equal to a rise of 40,723%.\n\n### 5\\. Binance Coin (BNB)\n\n- **Market cap: $90.3 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 10%**\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) is a form of cryptocurrency that you can use to trade and pay fees on [Binance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/binance-us-review/), one of the largest [crypto exchanges](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/best-crypto-exchanges/) in the world. Since its launch in 2017, Binance Coin has expanded past merely facilitating trades on Binance’s exchange platform. Now, it can be used for trading, payment processing or even booking travel arrangements. It can also be traded or exchanged for other forms of cryptocurrency, such as Ethereum or bitcoin.\n\nBNB’s price in 2017 was just $0.10. By late March 2025, its price had risen to around $634, a gain of 633,728%.\n\n**Related:** [How To Buy Cryptocurrency](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/how-to-buy-cryptocurrency/)\n\n### 6\\. Solana (SOL)\n\n- **Market cap: $73.9 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 2,025-03-25T13:31:38.663Z%**\n\nDeveloped to help power decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/defi-decentralized-finance/)) uses, decentralized apps (DApps) and smart contracts, Solana runs on a unique hybrid proof-of-stake and proof-of-history mechanisms to process transactions quickly and securely. SOL, Solana’s native token, powers the platform.\n\nWhen it launched in 2020, SOL’s price started at $0.77. By late March 2025, its price was around $144.53, a gain of 18,671%.\n\n### 7\\. U.S. Dollar Coin (USDC)\n\n- **Market cap: $59.8 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 2,025-03-25T13:31:38.853Z%**\n\nLike Tether, [USD Coin](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/usd-coin/) (USDC) is a stablecoin, meaning it’s backed by U.S. dollars and aims for a 1 USD to 1 USDC ratio. USDC is powered by Ethereum, and you can use USD Coin to complete global transactions.\n\n### 8\\. Dogecoin (DOGE)\n\n- **Market cap: $27.9 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 10%**\n\n[Dogecoin](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-dogecoin/) was famously started as a joke in 2013 but rapidly evolved into a prominent cryptocurrency thanks to a dedicated community and creative memes. Unlike many other cryptos, there is no limit on the number of Dogecoins that can be created, which leaves the currency susceptible to devaluation as supply increases.\n\nDogecoin’s price in 2017 was $0.0002. By March 2025, its price was at $0.19, up 93,745%.\n\n### 9\\. Cardano (ADA)\n\n- **Market cap: $26.7 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 18%**\n\nSomewhat later to the crypto scene, [Cardano](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/cardano-ada/) (ADA) is notable for its early embrace of proof-of-stake validation. This method expedites transaction time and [decreases energy usage](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/bitcoins-energy-usage-explained/) and environmental impact by removing the competitive, problem-solving aspect of transaction verification in platforms like bitcoin. Cardano also works like Ethereum to enable smart contracts and decentralized applications, which ADA, its native coin, powers.\n\nCardano’s ADA token has had relatively modest growth compared to other major crypto coins. In 2017, ADA’s price was $0.02. As of Mar. 25, 2025, its price was $0.76. This is an increase of 3,683%.\n\n### 10\\. TRON (TRX)\n\n- **Market cap: $21.6 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 2,025-03-25T13:31:38.838Z%**\n\nMuch like Solana, TRON is a blockchain designed to run smart contracts and other DeFi applications. TRX is the platform’s native cryptocurrency, which powers its proof-of-stake consensus algorithm.\n\nTRON was founded in 2017, and TRX was initially valued at $0.0019 per token. At its peak in 2018, TRX spiked as high as $0.2245, for a gain of 11,715% in a matter of months. TRX is currently valued around $0.23.\n\n_\\*Market caps and pricing sourced from coinmarketcap.com, current as of 8:31 a.m. UTC on Mar. 25, 2025._\n\n## What Are Cryptocurrencies?\n\n[Cryptocurrency](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-cryptocurrency/) is a form of currency that exists solely in digital form. Cryptocurrency can be used to pay for purchases online without going through an intermediary, such as a bank, or it can be held as an investment.\n\n### How Does Cryptocurrency Work?\n\nCryptocurrencies are various forms of digital money that are usually based on blockchain technology. Blockchain technology allows most cryptocurrencies to exist as “trustless” forms of transactions. This means there is no centralized authority overseeing the transactions on a cryptocurrency’s blockchain.\n\n### Why Are There So Many Cryptocurrencies?\n\nCryptocurrency is an emerging area with more than 9,000 crypto projects in existence as of March 2024.\n\nWhile some crypto function as currencies, others are used to develop infrastructure. For instance, in the case of Ethereum or Solana, developers are building other cryptos on top of these platform currencies, and that creates even more possibilities (and cryptos).\n\n## Pros and Cons of Cryptocurrency\n\nThere are both pros and cons to investing in cryptocurrencies. Some of the most common ones an investor might run into are:\n\n| Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Decentralization | High energy usage associated with mining |\n| Accessibility | Evolving government regulations |\n| Potentially high returns | Price volatility |\n| Transaction speed | Prevalence of scams and fraud |\n\n![Left Arrow](<Base64-Image-Removed>)![Right Arrow](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nSee MoreSee Less\n\n## How To Choose the Best Crypto To Invest In\n\nWhen choosing the best cryptocurrency to invest in, it is important to consider your individual goals, investing timeline and risk profile, just as you would with any investment. Additionally, you should do your due diligence to make sure that any crypto project you are interested in is legitimate and secure.\n\nIn general, investors should consider the following when evaluating a crypto:\n\n- Market capitalization\n- Liquidity\n- Security\n- Use case\n\nWhen exploring cryptocurrency investments, first consider the exchanges where the token is listed. Tokens featured on major exchanges generally offer better liquidity, attracting larger investors and reaching a broader audience, which in turn increases the potential buyer base.\n\n_– Maksym Repa, analyst at Symbolic Capital_\n\n## How To Invest in Cryptocurrency?\n\nYou can buy cryptocurrencies through crypto exchanges, such as [Coinbase](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/coinbase-review/), [Kraken](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/kraken-review/) or [Gemini](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/gemini-review/). In addition, some brokerages, such as WeBull and Robinhood, also allow consumers to buy cryptocurrencies.\n\n## How Much Does It Cost To Buy Cryptocurrency?\n\nHow much it costs to buy cryptocurrency depends on a number of factors, including which crypto you are buying. Many small altcoins trade for a fraction of a cent, while a single bitcoin will cost you tens of thousands of dollars. However, many brokerages and exchanges now allow fractional trading, offering investors the option to buy a portion of a cryptocurrency.\n\nThere are also often costs and fees associated with having a crypto wallet and/or an account on a brokerage or crypto exchange. Be sure that you understand all of the costs associated with buying and holding any cryptocurrency before you invest.\n\n## How To Report Crypto on Taxes\n\nIf you buy and sell coins, it’s important to pay attention to [cryptocurrency tax rules](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/taxes/what-are-cryptocurrency-taxes/).\n\nCryptocurrency is treated as a capital asset, like stocks, rather than cash. That means if you sell cryptocurrency at a profit, you’ll have to pay [capital gains taxes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/taxes/capital-gains-tax/). This is the case even if you use your crypto to pay for a purchase. If you receive a greater value for it than you paid, you’ll owe taxes on the difference.\n\nIs Robinhood Right For You?\n\n\nLearn more about Robinhood's Trading App\n\n[Learn More](https://www.myfinance.com/reporting/redir?redir=https%3A%2F%2Foc.brcclx.com%2Ft%2F%3Flid%3D26679471%26tid%3D%7Bsub_id%7D&utm_campaign=forbes-robinhood-invest-spl&sub_id=FAmXB7hhFDl63BgJxEUJcl_FwT9Cjjg0YB0)\n\nVia Robinhood's secure website\n\n## Crypto Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n### How does trading cryptocurrencies differ from trading stocks?\n\nWhile you can invest in cryptocurrencies, they differ a great deal from traditional investments, like stocks. When you buy stock, you are buying a share of ownership of a company, which means you’re entitled to do things like vote on the direction of the company. If that company goes bankrupt, you also may receive some compensation once its creditors have been paid from its liquidated assets.\n\nBuying cryptocurrency doesn’t grant you ownership over anything except the token itself; it’s more like exchanging one form of currency for another. If the crypto loses its value, you won’t receive anything after the fact.\n\nThere are several other key differences to keep in mind:\n\n- **Trading hours:** Stocks are only traded during stock exchange hours, typically 9:30 am to 4:30 pm ET, Monday through Friday. Cryptocurrency markets never close, so you can trade 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n- **Regulation:** Stocks are regulated financial products, meaning a governing body verifies their credentials and their finances are matters of public record. By contrast, cryptocurrencies are not regulated investment vehicles, so you may not be aware of the inner dynamics of your crypto or the developers working on it.\n- **Volatility:** Both stocks and cryptocurrency involve risk; the money you invest can lose value. However, stocks are directly linked to companies and generally rise and fall based on those companies’ performance. Cryptocurrency prices are more speculative—no one is quite sure of their value yet. That makes them much more volatile and affected by something as small as a celebrity’s tweet.\n\n### Are there cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds?\n\nGiven the thousands of cryptocurrencies in existence and the high volatility associated with most of them, it’s understandable you might want to take a [diversified](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-diversification/) approach to investing in crypto to minimize the risk that you might lose money.\n\nThere are [exchange-traded funds](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-are-etfs/), or ETFs, that trade in both bitcoin futures and bitcoin’s spot price. The [bitcoin ETF](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/best-bitcoin-etfs/) that is right for you, however, depends upon many factors, including your risk tolerance and investment horizon.\n\n### What are altcoins?\n\nWhen we first think of crypto, we usually think of bitcoin. That’s because bitcoin represents more than 45% of the total cryptocurrency market. So when we talk about any cryptos outside of bitcoin, all of those cryptos are considered altcoins.\n\nEthereum, for instance, is regarded as the most popular altcoin.\n\n### Why is bitcoin valuable?\n\nPart of what makes bitcoin so valuable is its scarcity. Bitcoin’s maximum supply is limited to 21 million coins. Currently, there are 19 million coins in circulation.\n\nTo create supply, bitcoin rewards [crypto miners](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/best-bitcoin-mining-software/) with a set bitcoin amount. To be exact, 6.25 BTC is issued when a miner has successfully mined a single block. To keep the process in check, the rewards given for mining bitcoin are cut in half almost every four years.\n\n### Why are cryptocurrencies important?\n\nWhile the initial premise of cryptocurrency was to fix the problems with traditional currencies, there are now a whole host of utility cryptocurrencies that have sprung up, thanks to the creation of the blockchain.\n\nWas this article helpful?\n\nShare your feedback\n\nSend feedback to the editorial team\n\nRate this Article\n\n★★★★★\n\nPlease rate the article\n\nEmail\n\nPlease enter valid email address\n\nComments\n\nWe'd love to hear from you, please enter your comments.\n\nInvalid email address\n\nSubmit\n\nThis form is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprise and the Google\n[Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and\n[Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) apply.\n\n\n![User Form](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/themes/fadv/assets/img/user-feedback-form/user-form-icon.svg)\n\n![Success Icon](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/themes/fadv/assets/img/user-feedback-form/success-icon.svg)\n\nThank You for your feedback!\n\n![Error Icon](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/themes/fadv/assets/img/user-feedback-form/error-icon.svg)\n\nSomething went wrong.

Bitcoin (BTC)\n\n- **Market cap: $1.7 trillion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 31%**\n\nCreated in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, [bitcoin](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-bitcoin/) (BTC) is the original cryptocurrency. As with most cryptocurrencies, BTC runs on a [blockchain](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2020/05/18/what-is-the-blockchain-and-why-does-it-matter/), or a ledger logging transactions distributed across a network of thousands of computers. Because additions to the distributed ledgers must be verified by solving a cryptographic puzzle, a process called proof of work, bitcoin is kept secure and safe from fraudsters.\n\nBitcoin’s price has skyrocketed as it’s become a household name. In May 2016, you could buy one bitcoin for about $500. As of Mar. 25, 2025, a single bitcoin’s price was around $87,702. That’s a growth of 17,440%.\n\n**Related:** [How To Buy Bitcoin](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/how-to-buy-bitcoin/)\n\n### 2\\. Ethereum (ETH)\n\n- **Market cap: $250.1 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: -40%**\n\nBoth a cryptocurrency and a blockchain platform, [Ethereum](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-ethereum-ether/) is a favorite of program developers because of its potential applications, like so-called smart contracts that automatically execute when conditions are met and non-fungible tokens ([NFTs](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/nft-non-fungible-token/)).\n\nEthereum has also experienced tremendous growth. From April 2016 to the end of March 2025, its price went from about $11 to around $2,073, increasing 18,743%.\n\n**Related:** [How To Buy Ethereum](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/how-to-buy-ethereum/)\n\n### 3\\. Tether (USDT)\n\n- **Market cap: $143.8 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 2,025-03-25T13:31:38.866Z%**\n\nUnlike some other forms of cryptocurrency, [Tether](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-tether-usdt/) (USDT) is a stablecoin, meaning it’s backed by fiat currencies like U.S. dollars and the Euro and hypothetically keeps a value equal to one of those denominations. In theory, this means Tether’s value is supposed to be more consistent than other cryptocurrencies, and it’s favored by investors who are wary of the extreme volatility of other coins.\n\n### 4\\. XRP (XRP)\n\n- **Market cap: $142.5 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 2,025-03-25T13:31:38.877Z%**\n\nCreated by some of the same founders as [Ripple](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-ripple-xrp/), a digital technology and payment processing company, XRP can be used on that network to facilitate exchanges of different currency types, including fiat currencies and other major cryptocurrencies.\n\nAt the beginning of 2017, the price of XRP was $0.006. As of Mar. 25, 2025, its price reached $2.45, equal to a rise of 40,723%.\n\n### 5\\. Binance Coin (BNB)\n\n- **Market cap: $90.3 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 10%**\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) is a form of cryptocurrency that you can use to trade and pay fees on [Binance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/binance-us-review/), one of the largest [crypto exchanges](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/best-crypto-exchanges/) in the world. Since its launch in 2017, Binance Coin has expanded past merely facilitating trades on Binance’s exchange platform. Now, it can be used for trading, payment processing or even booking travel arrangements. It can also be traded or exchanged for other forms of cryptocurrency, such as Ethereum or bitcoin.\n\nBNB’s price in 2017 was just $0.10. By late March 2025, its price had risen to around $634, a gain of 633,728%.\n\n**Related:** [How To Buy Cryptocurrency](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/how-to-buy-cryptocurrency/)\n\n### 6\\. Solana (SOL)\n\n- **Market cap: $73.9 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 2,025-03-25T13:31:38.663Z%**\n\nDeveloped to help power decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/defi-decentralized-finance/)) uses, decentralized apps (DApps) and smart contracts, Solana runs on a unique hybrid proof-of-stake and proof-of-history mechanisms to process transactions quickly and securely. SOL, Solana’s native token, powers the platform.\n\nWhen it launched in 2020, SOL’s price started at $0.77. By late March 2025, its price was around $144.53, a gain of 18,671%.\n\n### 7\\. U.S. Dollar Coin (USDC)\n\n- **Market cap: $59.8 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 2,025-03-25T13:31:38.853Z%**\n\nLike Tether, [USD Coin](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/usd-coin/) (USDC) is a stablecoin, meaning it’s backed by U.S. dollars and aims for a 1 USD to 1 USDC ratio. USDC is powered by Ethereum, and you can use USD Coin to complete global transactions.\n\n### 8\\. Dogecoin (DOGE)\n\n- **Market cap: $27.9 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 10%**\n\n[Dogecoin](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-dogecoin/) was famously started as a joke in 2013 but rapidly evolved into a prominent cryptocurrency thanks to a dedicated community and creative memes. Unlike many other cryptos, there is no limit on the number of Dogecoins that can be created, which leaves the currency susceptible to devaluation as supply increases.\n\nDogecoin’s price in 2017 was $0.0002. By March 2025, its price was at $0.19, up 93,745%.\n\n### 9\\. Cardano (ADA)\n\n- **Market cap: $26.7 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 18%**\n\nSomewhat later to the crypto scene, [Cardano](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/cardano-ada/) (ADA) is notable for its early embrace of proof-of-stake validation. This method expedites transaction time and [decreases energy usage](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/bitcoins-energy-usage-explained/) and environmental impact by removing the competitive, problem-solving aspect of transaction verification in platforms like bitcoin. Cardano also works like Ethereum to enable smart contracts and decentralized applications, which ADA, its native coin, powers.\n\nCardano’s ADA token has had relatively modest growth compared to other major crypto coins. In 2017, ADA’s price was $0.02. As of Mar. 25, 2025, its price was $0.76. This is an increase of 3,683%.\n\n### 10\\. TRON (TRX)\n\n- **Market cap: $21.6 billion**\n- **Year-over-year return: 2,025-03-25T13:31:38.838Z%**\n\nMuch like Solana, TRON is a blockchain designed to run smart contracts and other DeFi applications. TRX is the platform’s native cryptocurrency, which powers its proof-of-stake consensus algorithm.\n\nTRON was founded in 2017, and TRX was initially valued at $0.0019 per token. At its peak in 2018, TRX spiked as high as $0.2245, for a gain of 11,715% in a matter of months. TRX is currently valued around $0.23.\n\n_\\*Market caps and pricing sourced from coinmarketcap.com, current as of 8:31 a.m. UTC on Mar. 25, 2025._\n\n## What Are Cryptocurrencies?\n\n[Cryptocurrency](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-cryptocurrency/) is a form of currency that exists solely in digital form. Cryptocurrency can be used to pay for purchases online without going through an intermediary, such as a bank, or it can be held as an investment.\n\n### How Does Cryptocurrency Work?\n\nCryptocurrencies are various forms of digital money that are usually based on blockchain technology. Blockchain technology allows most cryptocurrencies to exist as “trustless” forms of transactions. This means there is no centralized authority overseeing the transactions on a cryptocurrency’s blockchain.\n\n### Why Are There So Many Cryptocurrencies?\n\nCryptocurrency is an emerging area with more than 9,000 crypto projects in existence as of March 2024.\n\nWhile some crypto function as currencies, others are used to develop infrastructure. For instance, in the case of Ethereum or Solana, developers are building other cryptos on top of these platform currencies, and that creates even more possibilities (and cryptos).\n\n## Pros and Cons of Cryptocurrency\n\nThere are both pros and cons to investing in cryptocurrencies. Some of the most common ones an investor might run into are:\n\n| Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Decentralization | High energy usage associated with mining |\n| Accessibility | Evolving government regulations |\n| Potentially high returns | Price volatility |\n| Transaction speed | Prevalence of scams and fraud |\n\n![Left Arrow](<Base64-Image-Removed>)![Right Arrow](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nSee MoreSee Less\n\n## How To Choose the Best Crypto To Invest In\n\nWhen choosing the best cryptocurrency to invest in, it is important to consider your individual goals, investing timeline and risk profile, just as you would with any investment. Additionally, you should do your due diligence to make sure that any crypto project you are interested in is legitimate and secure.\n\nIn general, investors should consider the following when evaluating a crypto:\n\n- Market capitalization\n- Liquidity\n- Security\n- Use case\n\nWhen exploring cryptocurrency investments, first consider the exchanges where the token is listed. Tokens featured on major exchanges generally offer better liquidity, attracting larger investors and reaching a broader audience, which in turn increases the potential buyer base.\n\n_– Maksym Repa, analyst at Symbolic Capital_\n\n## How To Invest in Cryptocurrency?\n\nYou can buy cryptocurrencies through crypto exchanges, such as [Coinbase](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/coinbase-review/), [Kraken](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/kraken-review/) or [Gemini](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/gemini-review/). In addition, some brokerages, such as WeBull and Robinhood, also allow consumers to buy cryptocurrencies.\n\n## How Much Does It Cost To Buy Cryptocurrency?\n\nHow much it costs to buy cryptocurrency depends on a number of factors, including which crypto you are buying. Many small altcoins trade for a fraction of a cent, while a single bitcoin will cost you tens of thousands of dollars. However, many brokerages and exchanges now allow fractional trading, offering investors the option to buy a portion of a cryptocurrency.\n\nThere are also often costs and fees associated with having a crypto wallet and/or an account on a brokerage or crypto exchange. Be sure that you understand all of the costs associated with buying and holding any cryptocurrency before you invest.\n\n## How To Report Crypto on Taxes\n\nIf you buy and sell coins, it’s important to pay attention to [cryptocurrency tax rules](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/taxes/what-are-cryptocurrency-taxes/).\n\nCryptocurrency is treated as a capital asset, like stocks, rather than cash. That means if you sell cryptocurrency at a profit, you’ll have to pay [capital gains taxes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/taxes/capital-gains-tax/). This is the case even if you use your crypto to pay for a purchase. If you receive a greater value for it than you paid, you’ll owe taxes on the difference.\n\nIs Robinhood Right For You?\n\n\nLearn more about Robinhood's Trading App\n\n[Learn More](https://www.myfinance.com/reporting/redir?redir=https%3A%2F%2Foc.brcclx.com%2Ft%2F%3Flid%3D26679471%26tid%3D%7Bsub_id%7D&utm_campaign=forbes-robinhood-invest-spl&sub_id=FAmXB7hhFDl63BgJxEUJcl_FwT9Cjjg0YB0)\n\nVia Robinhood's secure website\n\n## Crypto Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n### How does trading cryptocurrencies differ from trading stocks?\n\nWhile you can invest in cryptocurrencies, they differ a great deal from traditional investments, like stocks. When you buy stock, you are buying a share of ownership of a company, which means you’re entitled to do things like vote on the direction of the company. If that company goes bankrupt, you also may receive some compensation once its creditors have been paid from its liquidated assets.\n\nBuying cryptocurrency doesn’t grant you ownership over anything except the token itself; it’s more like exchanging one form of currency for another. If the crypto loses its value, you won’t receive anything after the fact.\n\nThere are several other key differences to keep in mind:\n\n- **Trading hours:** Stocks are only traded during stock exchange hours, typically 9:30 am to 4:30 pm ET, Monday through Friday. Cryptocurrency markets never close, so you can trade 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n- **Regulation:** Stocks are regulated financial products, meaning a governing body verifies their credentials and their finances are matters of public record. By contrast, cryptocurrencies are not regulated investment vehicles, so you may not be aware of the inner dynamics of your crypto or the developers working on it.\n- **Volatility:** Both stocks and cryptocurrency involve risk; the money you invest can lose value. However, stocks are directly linked to companies and generally rise and fall based on those companies’ performance. Cryptocurrency prices are more speculative—no one is quite sure of their value yet. That makes them much more volatile and affected by something as small as a celebrity’s tweet.\n\n### Are there cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds?\n\nGiven the thousands of cryptocurrencies in existence and the high volatility associated with most of them, it’s understandable you might want to take a [diversified](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-diversification/) approach to investing in crypto to minimize the risk that you might lose money.\n\nThere are [exchange-traded funds](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-are-etfs/), or ETFs, that trade in both bitcoin futures and bitcoin’s spot price. The [bitcoin ETF](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/best-bitcoin-etfs/) that is right for you, however, depends upon many factors, including your risk tolerance and investment horizon.\n\n### What are altcoins?\n\nWhen we first think of crypto, we usually think of bitcoin. That’s because bitcoin represents more than 45% of the total cryptocurrency market. So when we talk about any cryptos outside of bitcoin, all of those cryptos are considered altcoins.\n\nEthereum, for instance, is regarded as the most popular altcoin.\n\n### Why is bitcoin valuable?\n\nPart of what makes bitcoin so valuable is its scarcity. Bitcoin’s maximum supply is limited to 21 million coins. Currently, there are 19 million coins in circulation.\n\nTo create supply, bitcoin rewards [crypto miners](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/best-bitcoin-mining-software/) with a set bitcoin amount. To be exact, 6.25 BTC is issued when a miner has successfully mined a single block. To keep the process in check, the rewards given for mining bitcoin are cut in half almost every four years.\n\n### Why are cryptocurrencies important?\n\nWhile the initial premise of cryptocurrency was to fix the problems with traditional currencies, there are now a whole host of utility cryptocurrencies that have sprung up, thanks to the creation of the blockchain.\n\nWas this article helpful?\n\nShare your feedback\n\nSend feedback to the editorial team\n\nRate this Article\n\n★★★★★\n\nPlease rate the article\n\nEmail\n\nPlease enter valid email address\n\nComments\n\nWe'd love to hear from you, please enter your comments.\n\nInvalid email address\n\nSubmit\n\nThis form is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprise and the Google\n[Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and\n[Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) apply.\n\n\n![User Form](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/themes/fadv/assets/img/user-feedback-form/user-form-icon.svg)\n\n![Success Icon](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/themes/fadv/assets/img/user-feedback-form/success-icon.svg)\n\nThank You for your feedback!\n\n![Error Icon](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/themes/fadv/assets/img/user-feedback-form/error-icon.svg)\n\nSomething went wrong.
