However, the Trump Effect is now profound, as evidenced by the adoption of these technologies.”\\\n\\\nRipple’s legal battle against the SEC, begun in late 2020, saw the company accused of raising $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering. In 2023, Ripple won a partial victory after a federal judge ruled that XRP wasn’t a security when sold to retail investors, but was when sold to institutions. The agency appealed that decision but is now backing down.\\\n\\\n“It took longer than we would have liked… more than $150 million of legal bills, but we’re thrilled with the ultimate outcome,\" Garlinghouse said. \"It allows us to really unlock the U.S. market.”\\\n\\\nMeanwhile, XRP has been named by Trump as one of the cryptocurrencies that will make up a U.S.-focused crypto stockpile.\\\n\\\n[**Sign up now for** _**CryptoCodex**_](https://app.deform.cc/form/0f3efc64-cf8c-4c1d-8bfa-2350f0a25bf0/?page_number=0) **—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious**\\\n\\\n[Forbes‘Buckle Up’—Bitcoin Price Suddenly Braced For A ‘Cambrian Explosion’By Billy Bambrough](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/03/26/incredible-opportunity-bitcoin-price-suddenly-braced-for-a-cambrian-explosion/)\\\n\\\n![Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple, XRP, XRP price, bitcoin, bitcoin price, crypto, chart](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67e54b458164e7938249f1fd/Brad-Garlinghouse--Ripple--XRP--XRP-price--bitcoin--bitcoin-price--crypto--chart/960x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=1440)\\\n\\\nThe XRP price rocketed higher after Donald Trump's election victory, soaring along with the bitcoin ...

However, the Trump Effect is now profound, as evidenced by the adoption of these technologies.”\\\n\\\nRipple’s legal battle against the SEC, begun in late 2020, saw the company accused of raising $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering. In 2023, Ripple won a partial victory after a federal judge ruled that XRP wasn’t a security when sold to retail investors, but was when sold to institutions. The agency appealed that decision but is now backing down.\\\n\\\n“It took longer than we would have liked… more than $150 million of legal bills, but we’re thrilled with the ultimate outcome,\" Garlinghouse said. \"It allows us to really unlock the U.S. market.”\\\n\\\nMeanwhile, XRP has been named by Trump as one of the cryptocurrencies that will make up a U.S.-focused crypto stockpile.\\\n\\\n[**Sign up now for** _**CryptoCodex**_](https://app.deform.cc/form/0f3efc64-cf8c-4c1d-8bfa-2350f0a25bf0/?page_number=0) **—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious**\\\n\\\n[Forbes‘Buckle Up’—Bitcoin Price Suddenly Braced For A ‘Cambrian Explosion’By Billy Bambrough](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/03/26/incredible-opportunity-bitcoin-price-suddenly-braced-for-a-cambrian-explosion/)\\\n\\\n![Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple, XRP, XRP price, bitcoin, bitcoin price, crypto, chart](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67e54b458164e7938249f1fd/Brad-Garlinghouse--Ripple--XRP--XRP-price--bitcoin--bitcoin-price--crypto--chart/960x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=1440)\\\n\\\nThe XRP price rocketed higher after Donald Trump's election victory, soaring along with the bitcoin ...

However, the Trump Effect is now profound, as evidenced by the adoption of these technologies.”\\\n\\\nRipple’s legal battle against the SEC, begun in late 2020, saw the company accused of raising $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering. In 2023, Ripple won a partial victory after a federal judge ruled that XRP wasn’t a security when sold to retail investors, but was when sold to institutions. The agency appealed that decision but is now backing down.\\\n\\\n“It took longer than we would have liked… more than $150 million of legal bills, but we’re thrilled with the ultimate outcome,\" Garlinghouse said. \"It allows us to really unlock the U.S. market.”\\\n\\\nMeanwhile, XRP has been named by Trump as one of the cryptocurrencies that will make up a U.S.-focused crypto stockpile.\\\n\\\n[**Sign up now for** _**CryptoCodex**_](https://app.deform.cc/form/0f3efc64-cf8c-4c1d-8bfa-2350f0a25bf0/?page_number=0) **—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious**\\\n\\\n[Forbes‘Buckle Up’—Bitcoin Price Suddenly Braced For A ‘Cambrian Explosion’By Billy Bambrough](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/03/26/incredible-opportunity-bitcoin-price-suddenly-braced-for-a-cambrian-explosion/)\\\n\\\n![Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple, XRP, XRP price, bitcoin, bitcoin price, crypto, chart](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67e54b458164e7938249f1fd/Brad-Garlinghouse--Ripple--XRP--XRP-price--bitcoin--bitcoin-price--crypto--chart/960x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=1440)\\\n\\\nThe XRP price rocketed higher after Donald Trump's election victory, soaring along with the bitcoin ...
