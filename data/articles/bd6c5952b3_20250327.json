Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.\n\n1070 Views\n\nRussia has started using crypto for oil trades with China and India as it seeks to bypass Western sanctions, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-leans-cryptocurrencies-oil-trade-sources-say-2025-03-14/) on March 14, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n\nAccording to the report, some Russian oil companies have settled trades in [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/), [Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/), and stablecoins like Tether’s [USDT](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/). This strategy simplifies the conversion of Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupees into Russian Rubles, enabling smoother transactions despite financial restrictions.\n\nTypically, a Chinese buyer deposits Yuan into an offshore account controlled by an intermediary. The funds are then converted into crypto and transferred through multiple accounts before reaching a final destination in Russia, where they are exchanged for Rubles.\n\nThese transactions reportedly reach tens of millions of dollars per month.\n\nAlthough crypto adoption in Russia’s oil trade remains limited, it is [part of a broader trend](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-firms-turn-to-bitcoin-stablecoins-for-global-trade-amid-sanctions/). Over the past year, the country has [introduced new regulations](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-contemplating-permanently-legalizing-stablecoins-for-cross-border-payments/) governing [crypto mining](https://cryptoslate.com/russias-bitcoin-mining-demand-triples-amid-regulatory-shifts-and-price-rally/), taxation, and international trade.\n\n[Western sanctions imposed over Russia’s](https://cryptoslate.com/tether-freezes-27m-on-garantex-forcing-halt-of-russian-linked-exchange/) military actions in Ukraine have accelerated this shift toward digital assets. However, industry sources suggest oil firms may continue using cryptocurrencies even if sanctions are lifted due to their efficiency and transaction speed.\n\n## Digital rubles challenges\n\nWhile Russia increases its reliance on crypto for trade, its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project is facing significant hurdles.\n\nLast month, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina [announced](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-delays-digital-ruble-cbdc-launch-extends-pilot-phase-indefinitely/) an indefinite delay in the launch of the digital ruble. She attributed the setback to the need for further refinements to ensure that the currency benefits all stakeholders.\n\nHowever, a recent survey indicates that the digital ruble launch was postponed due to the inadequate IT infrastructure of banks that were expected to handle the project.\n\nThe survey of Russian banking experts revealed that 30% of financial institutions are not yet prepared to support the digital ruble. Experts explained that implementing the CBDC requires banks to upgrade their IT systems to handle increased transaction volumes.\n\nMeanwhile, 20% of banking IT specialists stated that their systems are fully equipped for the digital ruble. Another 50% said they are partially prepared but need further upgrades.\n\nAt the same time, around 14% of the respondents expressed concerns over potential information security risks associated with the currency.\n\nGiven these challenges, Russia’s national digital asset initiative could face further obstacles unless major financial institutions fully prepare for its adoption.\n\n###### Mentioned in this article\n\n[![Bitcoin](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/) [![Ethereum](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/) [![Tether](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Tether](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/) [![Tether Limited](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Tether Limited](https://cryptoslate.com/companies/tether/)\n\n[![XRP Turbo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201280%20453%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://link.cryptoslate.com/xrpturbo)\n\nPosted In: [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/news/bitcoin/), [China](https://cryptoslate.com/places/china/), [India](https://cryptoslate.com/places/india/), [Russia](https://cryptoslate.com/places/russia/), [Adoption](https://cryptoslate.com/adoption/), [Crypto](https://cryptoslate.com/crypto/), [Featured](https://cryptoslate.com/featured-news/)\n\nPeople were interested in these podcasts\n\n[Discover more podcasts →](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-oil-firms-using-bitcoin-and-ethereum-for-cross-border-payments-with-china/#)\n\nPlay Episode\n\n32min\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nEssi and Ben explain Turtle Club’s approach to liquidity monetization\n\nEsfandiar “Essi” Lagevardi, Founder and CEO of Turtle Club, and Benedikt “Ben” Schulz joined CryptoSlate’s Editor in Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill on the latest episode of the SlateCast. The duo shared insights on how Turtle Club is revolutionizing liquidity monetization and user engagement in Web3 by shifting the paradigm from value extraction to value creation.Redefining Liquidity Provision in Web3Essi described Turtle Club as a protocol focused on empowering users to monetize their on-chain activities across partner protocols, chains, and decentralized applications (dApps).“We’ve built a distribution protocol that allows anyone with a network to monetize user activity and return value to those generating it,” he explained.Essi emphasized the inefficiencies of traditional liquidity provisioning models, which he likened to “protocol-level loan sharking,” leading to adverse outcomes for stakeholders.Turtle Club’s approach addresses these inefficiencies by tracking users’ activities and distributing rewards based on protocols’ incentivization priorities, such as swap volume or liquidity contributions.Building Sustainable Incentive ModelsOne challenge Web3 protocols face is sustaining long-term user engagement. Essi highlighted that many protocols rely on short-term incentive campaigns that result in temporary spikes in activity, followed by steep drop-offs.“If your protocol doesn’t add sufficient value or utility, transitioning to a sustainable model becomes extremely challenging,” he stated.Instead, Turtle Club proposes a gradual, curve-like incentive model. Essi explained, “Start with moderate incentives to build traction, and as the protocol proves its value, transition to a sustainable framework while reducing dependency on subsidies.”Innovative Use of Treasury for Long-Term ValueBen elaborated on Turtle Club’s unique approach to treasury management, distinguishing it from other DAOs. Instead of selling tokens received from partner protocols, T\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nMax Li explains how decentralized AI will revolutionize trust in technology\n\nIn a recent SlateCast episode, Max Li, Founder and CEO of OORT, joined CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill to discuss the transformative potential of decentralization in artificial intelligence (AI). As AI systems become increasingly integrated into daily life, OORT’s blockchain-powered data infrastructure aims to address growing concerns around transparency, privacy, and ethics.Decentralization: The Key to Trustworthy AILi began the discussion by emphasizing the importance of transparency in building trust for AI systems. “If you want to build trust in AI, transparency is the key,” he explained. Centralized platforms like Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services (AWS), he argued, limit transparency due to their closed infrastructure.OORT’s decentralized data cloud aims to address this by using blockchain to ensure that the data collection and storage process is open and verifiable.“At OORT, we want to ensure that the data collection process is transparent and accessible, so users can trust the AI models being developed,” said Li.Addressing Privacy and Ethical ChallengesLi highlighted how centralized AI systems often raise privacy concerns, as users have little control over how their data is used. With OORT, decentralized storage ensures data integrity and prevents unauthorized modifications.“Data stored in centralized systems can be manipulated without users’ knowledge. A decentralized approach ensures that tampering is impossible without leaving a trace,” he explained.The ethical implications of AI were another major focus. Li suggested that a decentralized ecosystem could support the development of “auditing AI,” where independent agents assess the ethical compliance of various AI models.“Imagine an auditing AI agent, developed by a global community, that can evaluate the ethical standards of AI models—similar to how Linux was built collaboratively,” Li proposed.The Need for Open AI InfrastructureClosed AI systems, according to Li\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nNoelle Acheson on how crypto is shaping global macroeconomics\n\nIn a recent SlateCast episode, Noelle Acheson, author of the \"Crypto Is Macro Now\" newsletter, joined host Liam \"Akiba\" Wright and CryptoSlate CEO Nate Whitehill to discuss the growing influence of cryptocurrency on global macroeconomics and financial systems.Crypto's Impact on Monetary Policy: Acheson emphasized that crypto, particularly Bitcoin and stablecoins, is increasingly affecting monetary policy and capital flows worldwide. She noted:\"There is an alternative now to the central bank currency, to the commercial bank currency, to the fiat currency. There is an alternative that the authorities are struggling to control. And that is important for monetary policy.\"The discussion highlighted how cryptocurrencies provide options for individuals in countries with unstable currencies or restrictive financial policies.Stablecoins and Global FinanceThe conversation turned to the significant role of stablecoins, particularly Tether (USDT), in the global financial ecosystem. Acheson pointed out:\"Tether is a very key macro and crypto force. Crypto because of its size of its stablecoin and the spread of its use around the world, except the United States, and macro because of the amount it holds of U.S. government debt.\"The panelists discussed how Tether's large holdings of U.S. Treasuries could potentially influence macro-economic policies.Regulatory Landscape and U.S. ElectionsAcheson shared her thoughts on the potential impact of the 2024 U.S. presidential election on crypto regulations:\"A Trump victory would be better for crypto. A Kamala victory, we don't know. This is just still the very big unknown.\"She suggested that a change in SEC leadership could significantly shift the regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies, regardless of which party wins.Crypto and Economic TransparencyAcheson highlighted an often-overlooked aspect of crypto adoption\"That crypto is not all about risk. That it is actually relatively safe. That, this is especially overlooked, it enhances transpa\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nProof-of-Work security: Mike Siers on AuthLN’s bold vision for cyber defense\n\nIn a recent SlateCast episode, CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief, Liam “Akiba” Wright, spoke with AuthLN Founder Mike Siers about leveraging Bitcoin’s Lightning Network to address the massive problem of cybercrime. Drawing on his background as a military veteran, Siers explained how his proof-of-work-based authentication approach can impose genuine costs on would-be attackers.Mounting Cyber Threats and the Need for ChangeModern society relies heavily on digital infrastructure, yet hacks and data breaches continue to escalate. According to Siers, losses from cybercrime in 2024 alone are estimated at 9.5 trillion dollars, far eclipsing the comparatively smaller sums often highlighted in crypto-related thefts.“There are massive cyber attacks happening every single day,” he said. “We’re just going on as if everything is normal and our entire world is anchored online.”Siers argued that current security measures, such as firewalls and password protections, often act more like puzzles that attackers can eventually solve. “At the end of the day… attackers have the advantage of time,” he pointed out. “There really is no deterrence factor.”Introducing Proof-of-Work AuthenticationAuthLN seeks to close this gap by applying Bitcoin’s proof-of-work concept to authentication. As Siers put it:“What AuthLN is doing is introducing a cost mechanism via proof of work that wasn’t there before, that you’re going to need to satisfy prior to making any authentication attempt.”In practical terms, users (especially at an enterprise or nation-state level) must place a certain amount of Bitcoin as collateral through the Lightning Network before even trying to log in. If credentials fail to match, the collateral is forfeited—instantly turning break-in attempts into a costly gamble. Conversely, authorized users who “fat-finger” a password can still be protected by arrangements between AuthLN and their organization.Why the Lightning Network?Asked why AuthLN turned to Bitcoin, Siers highlighted the ro\n\n[Ad](https://cryptoslate.com/partnerships/)\n\n[![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2096%2096%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\\\\n\\\\\nCryptoSlate on Xx.com/cryptoslate\\\\\n\\\\\nGet the latest crypto news and expert insights.

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.\n\n1070 Views\n\nRussia has started using crypto for oil trades with China and India as it seeks to bypass Western sanctions, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-leans-cryptocurrencies-oil-trade-sources-say-2025-03-14/) on March 14, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n\nAccording to the report, some Russian oil companies have settled trades in [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/), [Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/), and stablecoins like Tether’s [USDT](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/). This strategy simplifies the conversion of Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupees into Russian Rubles, enabling smoother transactions despite financial restrictions.\n\nTypically, a Chinese buyer deposits Yuan into an offshore account controlled by an intermediary. The funds are then converted into crypto and transferred through multiple accounts before reaching a final destination in Russia, where they are exchanged for Rubles.\n\nThese transactions reportedly reach tens of millions of dollars per month.\n\nAlthough crypto adoption in Russia’s oil trade remains limited, it is [part of a broader trend](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-firms-turn-to-bitcoin-stablecoins-for-global-trade-amid-sanctions/). Over the past year, the country has [introduced new regulations](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-contemplating-permanently-legalizing-stablecoins-for-cross-border-payments/) governing [crypto mining](https://cryptoslate.com/russias-bitcoin-mining-demand-triples-amid-regulatory-shifts-and-price-rally/), taxation, and international trade.\n\n[Western sanctions imposed over Russia’s](https://cryptoslate.com/tether-freezes-27m-on-garantex-forcing-halt-of-russian-linked-exchange/) military actions in Ukraine have accelerated this shift toward digital assets. However, industry sources suggest oil firms may continue using cryptocurrencies even if sanctions are lifted due to their efficiency and transaction speed.\n\n## Digital rubles challenges\n\nWhile Russia increases its reliance on crypto for trade, its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project is facing significant hurdles.\n\nLast month, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina [announced](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-delays-digital-ruble-cbdc-launch-extends-pilot-phase-indefinitely/) an indefinite delay in the launch of the digital ruble. She attributed the setback to the need for further refinements to ensure that the currency benefits all stakeholders.\n\nHowever, a recent survey indicates that the digital ruble launch was postponed due to the inadequate IT infrastructure of banks that were expected to handle the project.\n\nThe survey of Russian banking experts revealed that 30% of financial institutions are not yet prepared to support the digital ruble. Experts explained that implementing the CBDC requires banks to upgrade their IT systems to handle increased transaction volumes.\n\nMeanwhile, 20% of banking IT specialists stated that their systems are fully equipped for the digital ruble. Another 50% said they are partially prepared but need further upgrades.\n\nAt the same time, around 14% of the respondents expressed concerns over potential information security risks associated with the currency.\n\nGiven these challenges, Russia’s national digital asset initiative could face further obstacles unless major financial institutions fully prepare for its adoption.\n\n###### Mentioned in this article\n\n[![Bitcoin](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/) [![Ethereum](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/) [![Tether](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Tether](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/) [![Tether Limited](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Tether Limited](https://cryptoslate.com/companies/tether/)\n\n[![XRP Turbo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201280%20453%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://link.cryptoslate.com/xrpturbo)\n\nPosted In: [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/news/bitcoin/), [China](https://cryptoslate.com/places/china/), [India](https://cryptoslate.com/places/india/), [Russia](https://cryptoslate.com/places/russia/), [Adoption](https://cryptoslate.com/adoption/), [Crypto](https://cryptoslate.com/crypto/), [Featured](https://cryptoslate.com/featured-news/)\n\nPeople were interested in these podcasts\n\n[Discover more podcasts →](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-oil-firms-using-bitcoin-and-ethereum-for-cross-border-payments-with-china/#)\n\nPlay Episode\n\n32min\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nEssi and Ben explain Turtle Club’s approach to liquidity monetization\n\nEsfandiar “Essi” Lagevardi, Founder and CEO of Turtle Club, and Benedikt “Ben” Schulz joined CryptoSlate’s Editor in Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill on the latest episode of the SlateCast. The duo shared insights on how Turtle Club is revolutionizing liquidity monetization and user engagement in Web3 by shifting the paradigm from value extraction to value creation.Redefining Liquidity Provision in Web3Essi described Turtle Club as a protocol focused on empowering users to monetize their on-chain activities across partner protocols, chains, and decentralized applications (dApps).“We’ve built a distribution protocol that allows anyone with a network to monetize user activity and return value to those generating it,” he explained.Essi emphasized the inefficiencies of traditional liquidity provisioning models, which he likened to “protocol-level loan sharking,” leading to adverse outcomes for stakeholders.Turtle Club’s approach addresses these inefficiencies by tracking users’ activities and distributing rewards based on protocols’ incentivization priorities, such as swap volume or liquidity contributions.Building Sustainable Incentive ModelsOne challenge Web3 protocols face is sustaining long-term user engagement. Essi highlighted that many protocols rely on short-term incentive campaigns that result in temporary spikes in activity, followed by steep drop-offs.“If your protocol doesn’t add sufficient value or utility, transitioning to a sustainable model becomes extremely challenging,” he stated.Instead, Turtle Club proposes a gradual, curve-like incentive model. Essi explained, “Start with moderate incentives to build traction, and as the protocol proves its value, transition to a sustainable framework while reducing dependency on subsidies.”Innovative Use of Treasury for Long-Term ValueBen elaborated on Turtle Club’s unique approach to treasury management, distinguishing it from other DAOs. Instead of selling tokens received from partner protocols, T\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nMax Li explains how decentralized AI will revolutionize trust in technology\n\nIn a recent SlateCast episode, Max Li, Founder and CEO of OORT, joined CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill to discuss the transformative potential of decentralization in artificial intelligence (AI). As AI systems become increasingly integrated into daily life, OORT’s blockchain-powered data infrastructure aims to address growing concerns around transparency, privacy, and ethics.Decentralization: The Key to Trustworthy AILi began the discussion by emphasizing the importance of transparency in building trust for AI systems. “If you want to build trust in AI, transparency is the key,” he explained. Centralized platforms like Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services (AWS), he argued, limit transparency due to their closed infrastructure.OORT’s decentralized data cloud aims to address this by using blockchain to ensure that the data collection and storage process is open and verifiable.“At OORT, we want to ensure that the data collection process is transparent and accessible, so users can trust the AI models being developed,” said Li.Addressing Privacy and Ethical ChallengesLi highlighted how centralized AI systems often raise privacy concerns, as users have little control over how their data is used. With OORT, decentralized storage ensures data integrity and prevents unauthorized modifications.“Data stored in centralized systems can be manipulated without users’ knowledge. A decentralized approach ensures that tampering is impossible without leaving a trace,” he explained.The ethical implications of AI were another major focus. Li suggested that a decentralized ecosystem could support the development of “auditing AI,” where independent agents assess the ethical compliance of various AI models.“Imagine an auditing AI agent, developed by a global community, that can evaluate the ethical standards of AI models—similar to how Linux was built collaboratively,” Li proposed.The Need for Open AI InfrastructureClosed AI systems, according to Li\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nNoelle Acheson on how crypto is shaping global macroeconomics\n\nIn a recent SlateCast episode, Noelle Acheson, author of the \"Crypto Is Macro Now\" newsletter, joined host Liam \"Akiba\" Wright and CryptoSlate CEO Nate Whitehill to discuss the growing influence of cryptocurrency on global macroeconomics and financial systems.Crypto's Impact on Monetary Policy: Acheson emphasized that crypto, particularly Bitcoin and stablecoins, is increasingly affecting monetary policy and capital flows worldwide. She noted:\"There is an alternative now to the central bank currency, to the commercial bank currency, to the fiat currency. There is an alternative that the authorities are struggling to control. And that is important for monetary policy.\"The discussion highlighted how cryptocurrencies provide options for individuals in countries with unstable currencies or restrictive financial policies.Stablecoins and Global FinanceThe conversation turned to the significant role of stablecoins, particularly Tether (USDT), in the global financial ecosystem. Acheson pointed out:\"Tether is a very key macro and crypto force. Crypto because of its size of its stablecoin and the spread of its use around the world, except the United States, and macro because of the amount it holds of U.S. government debt.\"The panelists discussed how Tether's large holdings of U.S. Treasuries could potentially influence macro-economic policies.Regulatory Landscape and U.S. ElectionsAcheson shared her thoughts on the potential impact of the 2024 U.S. presidential election on crypto regulations:\"A Trump victory would be better for crypto. A Kamala victory, we don't know. This is just still the very big unknown.\"She suggested that a change in SEC leadership could significantly shift the regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies, regardless of which party wins.Crypto and Economic TransparencyAcheson highlighted an often-overlooked aspect of crypto adoption\"That crypto is not all about risk. That it is actually relatively safe. That, this is especially overlooked, it enhances transpa\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nProof-of-Work security: Mike Siers on AuthLN’s bold vision for cyber defense\n\nIn a recent SlateCast episode, CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief, Liam “Akiba” Wright, spoke with AuthLN Founder Mike Siers about leveraging Bitcoin’s Lightning Network to address the massive problem of cybercrime. Drawing on his background as a military veteran, Siers explained how his proof-of-work-based authentication approach can impose genuine costs on would-be attackers.Mounting Cyber Threats and the Need for ChangeModern society relies heavily on digital infrastructure, yet hacks and data breaches continue to escalate. According to Siers, losses from cybercrime in 2024 alone are estimated at 9.5 trillion dollars, far eclipsing the comparatively smaller sums often highlighted in crypto-related thefts.“There are massive cyber attacks happening every single day,” he said. “We’re just going on as if everything is normal and our entire world is anchored online.”Siers argued that current security measures, such as firewalls and password protections, often act more like puzzles that attackers can eventually solve. “At the end of the day… attackers have the advantage of time,” he pointed out. “There really is no deterrence factor.”Introducing Proof-of-Work AuthenticationAuthLN seeks to close this gap by applying Bitcoin’s proof-of-work concept to authentication. As Siers put it:“What AuthLN is doing is introducing a cost mechanism via proof of work that wasn’t there before, that you’re going to need to satisfy prior to making any authentication attempt.”In practical terms, users (especially at an enterprise or nation-state level) must place a certain amount of Bitcoin as collateral through the Lightning Network before even trying to log in. If credentials fail to match, the collateral is forfeited—instantly turning break-in attempts into a costly gamble. Conversely, authorized users who “fat-finger” a password can still be protected by arrangements between AuthLN and their organization.Why the Lightning Network?Asked why AuthLN turned to Bitcoin, Siers highlighted the ro\n\n[Ad](https://cryptoslate.com/partnerships/)\n\n[![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2096%2096%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\\\\n\\\\\nCryptoSlate on Xx.com/cryptoslate\\\\\n\\\\\nGet the latest crypto news and expert insights.

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.\n\n1070 Views\n\nRussia has started using crypto for oil trades with China and India as it seeks to bypass Western sanctions, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-leans-cryptocurrencies-oil-trade-sources-say-2025-03-14/) on March 14, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n\nAccording to the report, some Russian oil companies have settled trades in [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/), [Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/), and stablecoins like Tether’s [USDT](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/). This strategy simplifies the conversion of Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupees into Russian Rubles, enabling smoother transactions despite financial restrictions.\n\nTypically, a Chinese buyer deposits Yuan into an offshore account controlled by an intermediary. The funds are then converted into crypto and transferred through multiple accounts before reaching a final destination in Russia, where they are exchanged for Rubles.\n\nThese transactions reportedly reach tens of millions of dollars per month.\n\nAlthough crypto adoption in Russia’s oil trade remains limited, it is [part of a broader trend](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-firms-turn-to-bitcoin-stablecoins-for-global-trade-amid-sanctions/). Over the past year, the country has [introduced new regulations](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-contemplating-permanently-legalizing-stablecoins-for-cross-border-payments/) governing [crypto mining](https://cryptoslate.com/russias-bitcoin-mining-demand-triples-amid-regulatory-shifts-and-price-rally/), taxation, and international trade.\n\n[Western sanctions imposed over Russia’s](https://cryptoslate.com/tether-freezes-27m-on-garantex-forcing-halt-of-russian-linked-exchange/) military actions in Ukraine have accelerated this shift toward digital assets. However, industry sources suggest oil firms may continue using cryptocurrencies even if sanctions are lifted due to their efficiency and transaction speed.\n\n## Digital rubles challenges\n\nWhile Russia increases its reliance on crypto for trade, its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project is facing significant hurdles.\n\nLast month, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina [announced](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-delays-digital-ruble-cbdc-launch-extends-pilot-phase-indefinitely/) an indefinite delay in the launch of the digital ruble. She attributed the setback to the need for further refinements to ensure that the currency benefits all stakeholders.\n\nHowever, a recent survey indicates that the digital ruble launch was postponed due to the inadequate IT infrastructure of banks that were expected to handle the project.\n\nThe survey of Russian banking experts revealed that 30% of financial institutions are not yet prepared to support the digital ruble. Experts explained that implementing the CBDC requires banks to upgrade their IT systems to handle increased transaction volumes.\n\nMeanwhile, 20% of banking IT specialists stated that their systems are fully equipped for the digital ruble. Another 50% said they are partially prepared but need further upgrades.\n\nAt the same time, around 14% of the respondents expressed concerns over potential information security risks associated with the currency.\n\nGiven these challenges, Russia’s national digital asset initiative could face further obstacles unless major financial institutions fully prepare for its adoption.\n\n###### Mentioned in this article\n\n[![Bitcoin](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/) [![Ethereum](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/) [![Tether](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Tether](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/) [![Tether Limited](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Tether Limited](https://cryptoslate.com/companies/tether/)\n\n[![XRP Turbo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201280%20453%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://link.cryptoslate.com/xrpturbo)\n\nPosted In: [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/news/bitcoin/), [China](https://cryptoslate.com/places/china/), [India](https://cryptoslate.com/places/india/), [Russia](https://cryptoslate.com/places/russia/), [Adoption](https://cryptoslate.com/adoption/), [Crypto](https://cryptoslate.com/crypto/), [Featured](https://cryptoslate.com/featured-news/)\n\nPeople were interested in these podcasts\n\n[Discover more podcasts →](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-oil-firms-using-bitcoin-and-ethereum-for-cross-border-payments-with-china/#)\n\nPlay Episode\n\n32min\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nEssi and Ben explain Turtle Club’s approach to liquidity monetization\n\nEsfandiar “Essi” Lagevardi, Founder and CEO of Turtle Club, and Benedikt “Ben” Schulz joined CryptoSlate’s Editor in Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill on the latest episode of the SlateCast. The duo shared insights on how Turtle Club is revolutionizing liquidity monetization and user engagement in Web3 by shifting the paradigm from value extraction to value creation.Redefining Liquidity Provision in Web3Essi described Turtle Club as a protocol focused on empowering users to monetize their on-chain activities across partner protocols, chains, and decentralized applications (dApps).“We’ve built a distribution protocol that allows anyone with a network to monetize user activity and return value to those generating it,” he explained.Essi emphasized the inefficiencies of traditional liquidity provisioning models, which he likened to “protocol-level loan sharking,” leading to adverse outcomes for stakeholders.Turtle Club’s approach addresses these inefficiencies by tracking users’ activities and distributing rewards based on protocols’ incentivization priorities, such as swap volume or liquidity contributions.Building Sustainable Incentive ModelsOne challenge Web3 protocols face is sustaining long-term user engagement. Essi highlighted that many protocols rely on short-term incentive campaigns that result in temporary spikes in activity, followed by steep drop-offs.“If your protocol doesn’t add sufficient value or utility, transitioning to a sustainable model becomes extremely challenging,” he stated.Instead, Turtle Club proposes a gradual, curve-like incentive model. Essi explained, “Start with moderate incentives to build traction, and as the protocol proves its value, transition to a sustainable framework while reducing dependency on subsidies.”Innovative Use of Treasury for Long-Term ValueBen elaborated on Turtle Club’s unique approach to treasury management, distinguishing it from other DAOs. Instead of selling tokens received from partner protocols, T\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nMax Li explains how decentralized AI will revolutionize trust in technology\n\nIn a recent SlateCast episode, Max Li, Founder and CEO of OORT, joined CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill to discuss the transformative potential of decentralization in artificial intelligence (AI). As AI systems become increasingly integrated into daily life, OORT’s blockchain-powered data infrastructure aims to address growing concerns around transparency, privacy, and ethics.Decentralization: The Key to Trustworthy AILi began the discussion by emphasizing the importance of transparency in building trust for AI systems. “If you want to build trust in AI, transparency is the key,” he explained. Centralized platforms like Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services (AWS), he argued, limit transparency due to their closed infrastructure.OORT’s decentralized data cloud aims to address this by using blockchain to ensure that the data collection and storage process is open and verifiable.“At OORT, we want to ensure that the data collection process is transparent and accessible, so users can trust the AI models being developed,” said Li.Addressing Privacy and Ethical ChallengesLi highlighted how centralized AI systems often raise privacy concerns, as users have little control over how their data is used. With OORT, decentralized storage ensures data integrity and prevents unauthorized modifications.“Data stored in centralized systems can be manipulated without users’ knowledge. A decentralized approach ensures that tampering is impossible without leaving a trace,” he explained.The ethical implications of AI were another major focus. Li suggested that a decentralized ecosystem could support the development of “auditing AI,” where independent agents assess the ethical compliance of various AI models.“Imagine an auditing AI agent, developed by a global community, that can evaluate the ethical standards of AI models—similar to how Linux was built collaboratively,” Li proposed.The Need for Open AI InfrastructureClosed AI systems, according to Li\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nNoelle Acheson on how crypto is shaping global macroeconomics\n\nIn a recent SlateCast episode, Noelle Acheson, author of the \"Crypto Is Macro Now\" newsletter, joined host Liam \"Akiba\" Wright and CryptoSlate CEO Nate Whitehill to discuss the growing influence of cryptocurrency on global macroeconomics and financial systems.Crypto's Impact on Monetary Policy: Acheson emphasized that crypto, particularly Bitcoin and stablecoins, is increasingly affecting monetary policy and capital flows worldwide. She noted:\"There is an alternative now to the central bank currency, to the commercial bank currency, to the fiat currency. There is an alternative that the authorities are struggling to control. And that is important for monetary policy.\"The discussion highlighted how cryptocurrencies provide options for individuals in countries with unstable currencies or restrictive financial policies.Stablecoins and Global FinanceThe conversation turned to the significant role of stablecoins, particularly Tether (USDT), in the global financial ecosystem. Acheson pointed out:\"Tether is a very key macro and crypto force. Crypto because of its size of its stablecoin and the spread of its use around the world, except the United States, and macro because of the amount it holds of U.S. government debt.\"The panelists discussed how Tether's large holdings of U.S. Treasuries could potentially influence macro-economic policies.Regulatory Landscape and U.S. ElectionsAcheson shared her thoughts on the potential impact of the 2024 U.S. presidential election on crypto regulations:\"A Trump victory would be better for crypto. A Kamala victory, we don't know. This is just still the very big unknown.\"She suggested that a change in SEC leadership could significantly shift the regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies, regardless of which party wins.Crypto and Economic TransparencyAcheson highlighted an often-overlooked aspect of crypto adoption\"That crypto is not all about risk. That it is actually relatively safe. That, this is especially overlooked, it enhances transpa\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nProof-of-Work security: Mike Siers on AuthLN’s bold vision for cyber defense\n\nIn a recent SlateCast episode, CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief, Liam “Akiba” Wright, spoke with AuthLN Founder Mike Siers about leveraging Bitcoin’s Lightning Network to address the massive problem of cybercrime. Drawing on his background as a military veteran, Siers explained how his proof-of-work-based authentication approach can impose genuine costs on would-be attackers.Mounting Cyber Threats and the Need for ChangeModern society relies heavily on digital infrastructure, yet hacks and data breaches continue to escalate. According to Siers, losses from cybercrime in 2024 alone are estimated at 9.5 trillion dollars, far eclipsing the comparatively smaller sums often highlighted in crypto-related thefts.“There are massive cyber attacks happening every single day,” he said. “We’re just going on as if everything is normal and our entire world is anchored online.”Siers argued that current security measures, such as firewalls and password protections, often act more like puzzles that attackers can eventually solve. “At the end of the day… attackers have the advantage of time,” he pointed out. “There really is no deterrence factor.”Introducing Proof-of-Work AuthenticationAuthLN seeks to close this gap by applying Bitcoin’s proof-of-work concept to authentication. As Siers put it:“What AuthLN is doing is introducing a cost mechanism via proof of work that wasn’t there before, that you’re going to need to satisfy prior to making any authentication attempt.”In practical terms, users (especially at an enterprise or nation-state level) must place a certain amount of Bitcoin as collateral through the Lightning Network before even trying to log in. If credentials fail to match, the collateral is forfeited—instantly turning break-in attempts into a costly gamble. Conversely, authorized users who “fat-finger” a password can still be protected by arrangements between AuthLN and their organization.Why the Lightning Network?Asked why AuthLN turned to Bitcoin, Siers highlighted the ro\n\n[Ad](https://cryptoslate.com/partnerships/)\n\n[![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2096%2096%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\\\\n\\\\\nCryptoSlate on Xx.com/cryptoslate\\\\\n\\\\\nGet the latest crypto news and expert insights.
