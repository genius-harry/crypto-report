U.S. President Donald Trump’s deadline to impose steep tariffs.\n\nThe leading digital asset edged up 1% to $83,465, according to crypto data provider [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin). Ethereum, the second largest crypto by market capitalization, rose 1.1% to about $1,840, while Solana, the sixth largest, climbed 1.4% to over $125.\n\nThe upturn comes as investors look toward April 2, when Trump plans on announcing the tariffs in a ceremony scheduled for the White House Rose Garden. The crypto market has been teetering amid widespread market jitters as investors reel from Trump’s erratic trade policies.\n\nBitcoin’s price was recently down 23% from its record high of $108,800 set on Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration day. On Monday, the S&P 500 fell again into correction territory, sinking more than 10% below the market index’s peak in January, before regaining some ground.\n\nBitcoin price fell as low as $81,500 after [_The Wall Street Journal_](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-says-he-couldnt-care-less-if-car-prices-go-up-b9b4a211) reported that Trump has recently pushed advisors to be more aggressive on tariffs on Sunday. A week ago, it changed hands around $88,500, as it appeared Trump might impose more [limited](https://decrypt.co/311300/white-house-tariffs-bitcoin-economic-jitters) measures.\n\nAfter tilting toward “Extreme Fear,” or a value of 20 last month, the [Crypto Fear & Greed Index](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/), a measure of investor sentiment, has since climbed to “Fear,” or a value of 34. Prediction market traders on MYRIAD [foresee](https://myriad.markets/markets/fear-and-greed-index-at-30-or-higher-on-april-2) an 80% chance that the index will be at 30 or above on Tuesday. (Disclosure: MYRIAD is owned by Decrypt’s parent company, DASTAN.)\n\nEthereum and other altcoins have been hit much harder than Bitcoin since last January, with ETH’s price dropping to a 17-month low of $1,784 on Monday—a 16% fall over the past month.\n\n![Image created by Decrypt using AI](https://img.decrypt.co/insecure/rs:fit:3840:0:0:0/plain/https://cdn.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bitcoin-ethereum-red-down-market-gID_7.jpeg@webp)\n\n## [Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP Fall to Weekly Lows as Liquidations Spike Above $450 Million](https://decrypt.co/312163/bitcoin-ethereum-xrp-weekly-lows-liquidations)\n\nBitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies are in the red Friday, with top coins falling to their lowest prices in at least a week as stock markets are similarly rattled by hotter-than-expected inflation data.\nThe price of Bitcoin dipped to $83,609 early Friday afternoon, and is currently down about 4% on the day at a current price of $83,736. It's down just 0.4% on the week, but the Friday slide has cooled rising momentum seen in recent days.\nOther top coins have shown sharper losses over the pas...\n\nThe volatile start to the week followed some positive signs last week when investors allocated $195 million to Bitcoin investment products, per CoinShares. The crypto asset manager [noted](https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-227-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-b8acc1fc9411) in a report on Monday that recent activity resembled “positive but cautious behavior.”\n\nSome analysts believe that markets have digested the bulk of Trump’s tariff threats and that [Bitcoin’s price has bottomed](https://decrypt.co/311539/has-the-bitcoin-market-bottomed-experts-weigh-in). Still, many have pointed to Trump’s “Liberation Day” on April 2 as a wild card, given that the White House’s stance on tariffs has shifted frequently.\n\nGold, the traditional safe-haven asset that has rallied alongside Trump’s trade utterances, set a new record on Monday. The precious metal was recently [changing hands](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/gold) at around $3,153 per ounce, up more than 1%.\n\nBitcoin’s advocates often portray the cryptocurrency as a store of value, but it’s been tracking equities recently, especially the Nasdaq, according to researcher Noelle Acheson. The tech-heavy index and Bitcoin’s price have each fallen over 5% in the past week.\n\n\"BTC is reminding us that it is seen as a risk asset by many,” Acheson wrote in a Telegram message to _Decrypt_ on Friday. “Risk sentiment is weak, largely due to uncertainty around the impact of tariffs and growing doubts, even among Fed officials, that rate cuts are coming any time soon.”\n\nMonday marks the end to what has been a tumultuous quarter for the crypto market. Bitcoin is on track to finish down 11% from the beginning of January, while Ethereum is slated to record a 45% fall, according to the crypto data provider [CoinGlass](https://www.coinglass.com/today).\n\n_Edited by James Rubin_\n\n### Daily Debrief Newsletter\n\nStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.\n\nYour Email\n\nGet it!\n\nGet it!\n\n### Recommended News\n\n- ![Source: Shutterstock](https://img.decrypt.co/insecure/rs:fit:3840:0:0:0/plain/https://cdn.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/japan-bitcon-japanese-yen-btc-gID_7.jpg@webp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## [Metaplanet Accelerates Bitcoin Buying Strategy, Issues $13.3 Million in New Bonds](https://decrypt.co/312459/metaplanet-accelerates-bitcoin-buying-strategy)\n\n\n\nJapan’s biggest Bitcoin treasury company, Metaplanet, has issued more debt to buy the cryptocurrency.\nThe firm, which trades on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, said Monday that it had issued a two billion yen ($13.3 million) zero-coupon ordinary bond to fund more Bitcoin buys.\nMetaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich made the announcement on X, saying the company—which is also an investment firm that owns a hotel—was “buying the dip.”\n\n押し目買い！Buying the dip! https://t.co/nOIQrAveap\n— Simon Gerovich (@gerovich)...\n\n- ![Elon Musk.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s deadline to impose steep tariffs.\n\nThe leading digital asset edged up 1% to $83,465, according to crypto data provider [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin). Ethereum, the second largest crypto by market capitalization, rose 1.1% to about $1,840, while Solana, the sixth largest, climbed 1.4% to over $125.\n\nThe upturn comes as investors look toward April 2, when Trump plans on announcing the tariffs in a ceremony scheduled for the White House Rose Garden. The crypto market has been teetering amid widespread market jitters as investors reel from Trump’s erratic trade policies.\n\nBitcoin’s price was recently down 23% from its record high of $108,800 set on Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration day. On Monday, the S&P 500 fell again into correction territory, sinking more than 10% below the market index’s peak in January, before regaining some ground.\n\nBitcoin price fell as low as $81,500 after [_The Wall Street Journal_](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-says-he-couldnt-care-less-if-car-prices-go-up-b9b4a211) reported that Trump has recently pushed advisors to be more aggressive on tariffs on Sunday. A week ago, it changed hands around $88,500, as it appeared Trump might impose more [limited](https://decrypt.co/311300/white-house-tariffs-bitcoin-economic-jitters) measures.\n\nAfter tilting toward “Extreme Fear,” or a value of 20 last month, the [Crypto Fear & Greed Index](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/), a measure of investor sentiment, has since climbed to “Fear,” or a value of 34. Prediction market traders on MYRIAD [foresee](https://myriad.markets/markets/fear-and-greed-index-at-30-or-higher-on-april-2) an 80% chance that the index will be at 30 or above on Tuesday. (Disclosure: MYRIAD is owned by Decrypt’s parent company, DASTAN.)\n\nEthereum and other altcoins have been hit much harder than Bitcoin since last January, with ETH’s price dropping to a 17-month low of $1,784 on Monday—a 16% fall over the past month.\n\n![Image created by Decrypt using AI](https://img.decrypt.co/insecure/rs:fit:3840:0:0:0/plain/https://cdn.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bitcoin-ethereum-red-down-market-gID_7.jpeg@webp)\n\n## [Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP Fall to Weekly Lows as Liquidations Spike Above $450 Million](https://decrypt.co/312163/bitcoin-ethereum-xrp-weekly-lows-liquidations)\n\nBitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies are in the red Friday, with top coins falling to their lowest prices in at least a week as stock markets are similarly rattled by hotter-than-expected inflation data.\nThe price of Bitcoin dipped to $83,609 early Friday afternoon, and is currently down about 4% on the day at a current price of $83,736. It's down just 0.4% on the week, but the Friday slide has cooled rising momentum seen in recent days.\nOther top coins have shown sharper losses over the pas...\n\nThe volatile start to the week followed some positive signs last week when investors allocated $195 million to Bitcoin investment products, per CoinShares. The crypto asset manager [noted](https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-227-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-b8acc1fc9411) in a report on Monday that recent activity resembled “positive but cautious behavior.”\n\nSome analysts believe that markets have digested the bulk of Trump’s tariff threats and that [Bitcoin’s price has bottomed](https://decrypt.co/311539/has-the-bitcoin-market-bottomed-experts-weigh-in). Still, many have pointed to Trump’s “Liberation Day” on April 2 as a wild card, given that the White House’s stance on tariffs has shifted frequently.\n\nGold, the traditional safe-haven asset that has rallied alongside Trump’s trade utterances, set a new record on Monday. The precious metal was recently [changing hands](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/gold) at around $3,153 per ounce, up more than 1%.\n\nBitcoin’s advocates often portray the cryptocurrency as a store of value, but it’s been tracking equities recently, especially the Nasdaq, according to researcher Noelle Acheson. The tech-heavy index and Bitcoin’s price have each fallen over 5% in the past week.\n\n\"BTC is reminding us that it is seen as a risk asset by many,” Acheson wrote in a Telegram message to _Decrypt_ on Friday. “Risk sentiment is weak, largely due to uncertainty around the impact of tariffs and growing doubts, even among Fed officials, that rate cuts are coming any time soon.”\n\nMonday marks the end to what has been a tumultuous quarter for the crypto market. Bitcoin is on track to finish down 11% from the beginning of January, while Ethereum is slated to record a 45% fall, according to the crypto data provider [CoinGlass](https://www.coinglass.com/today).\n\n_Edited by James Rubin_\n\n### Daily Debrief Newsletter\n\nStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.\n\nYour Email\n\nGet it!\n\nGet it!\n\n### Recommended News\n\n- ![Source: Shutterstock](https://img.decrypt.co/insecure/rs:fit:3840:0:0:0/plain/https://cdn.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/japan-bitcon-japanese-yen-btc-gID_7.jpg@webp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## [Metaplanet Accelerates Bitcoin Buying Strategy, Issues $13.3 Million in New Bonds](https://decrypt.co/312459/metaplanet-accelerates-bitcoin-buying-strategy)\n\n\n\nJapan’s biggest Bitcoin treasury company, Metaplanet, has issued more debt to buy the cryptocurrency.\nThe firm, which trades on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, said Monday that it had issued a two billion yen ($13.3 million) zero-coupon ordinary bond to fund more Bitcoin buys.\nMetaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich made the announcement on X, saying the company—which is also an investment firm that owns a hotel—was “buying the dip.”\n\n押し目買い！Buying the dip! https://t.co/nOIQrAveap\n— Simon Gerovich (@gerovich)...\n\n- ![Elon Musk.

*\n\n[Discover SCENE](https://decrypt.co/scene)\n\nThe price of Bitcoin fell to a two-week low on Monday before recovering some losses, as other major cryptocurrencies also seesawed two days ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s deadline to impose steep tariffs.\n\nThe leading digital asset edged up 1% to $83,465, according to crypto data provider [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin). Ethereum, the second largest crypto by market capitalization, rose 1.1% to about $1,840, while Solana, the sixth largest, climbed 1.4% to over $125.\n\nThe upturn comes as investors look toward April 2, when Trump plans on announcing the tariffs in a ceremony scheduled for the White House Rose Garden. The crypto market has been teetering amid widespread market jitters as investors reel from Trump’s erratic trade policies.\n\nBitcoin’s price was recently down 23% from its record high of $108,800 set on Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration day. On Monday, the S&P 500 fell again into correction territory, sinking more than 10% below the market index’s peak in January, before regaining some ground.\n\nBitcoin price fell as low as $81,500 after [_The Wall Street Journal_](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-says-he-couldnt-care-less-if-car-prices-go-up-b9b4a211) reported that Trump has recently pushed advisors to be more aggressive on tariffs on Sunday. A week ago, it changed hands around $88,500, as it appeared Trump might impose more [limited](https://decrypt.co/311300/white-house-tariffs-bitcoin-economic-jitters) measures.\n\nAfter tilting toward “Extreme Fear,” or a value of 20 last month, the [Crypto Fear & Greed Index](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/), a measure of investor sentiment, has since climbed to “Fear,” or a value of 34. Prediction market traders on MYRIAD [foresee](https://myriad.markets/markets/fear-and-greed-index-at-30-or-higher-on-april-2) an 80% chance that the index will be at 30 or above on Tuesday. (Disclosure: MYRIAD is owned by Decrypt’s parent company, DASTAN.)\n\nEthereum and other altcoins have been hit much harder than Bitcoin since last January, with ETH’s price dropping to a 17-month low of $1,784 on Monday—a 16% fall over the past month.\n\n![Image created by Decrypt using AI](https://img.decrypt.co/insecure/rs:fit:3840:0:0:0/plain/https://cdn.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bitcoin-ethereum-red-down-market-gID_7.jpeg@webp)\n\n## [Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP Fall to Weekly Lows as Liquidations Spike Above $450 Million](https://decrypt.co/312163/bitcoin-ethereum-xrp-weekly-lows-liquidations)\n\nBitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies are in the red Friday, with top coins falling to their lowest prices in at least a week as stock markets are similarly rattled by hotter-than-expected inflation data.\nThe price of Bitcoin dipped to $83,609 early Friday afternoon, and is currently down about 4% on the day at a current price of $83,736. It's down just 0.4% on the week, but the Friday slide has cooled rising momentum seen in recent days.\nOther top coins have shown sharper losses over the pas...\n\nThe volatile start to the week followed some positive signs last week when investors allocated $195 million to Bitcoin investment products, per CoinShares. The crypto asset manager [noted](https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-227-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-b8acc1fc9411) in a report on Monday that recent activity resembled “positive but cautious behavior.”\n\nSome analysts believe that markets have digested the bulk of Trump’s tariff threats and that [Bitcoin’s price has bottomed](https://decrypt.co/311539/has-the-bitcoin-market-bottomed-experts-weigh-in). Still, many have pointed to Trump’s “Liberation Day” on April 2 as a wild card, given that the White House’s stance on tariffs has shifted frequently.\n\nGold, the traditional safe-haven asset that has rallied alongside Trump’s trade utterances, set a new record on Monday. The precious metal was recently [changing hands](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/gold) at around $3,153 per ounce, up more than 1%.\n\nBitcoin’s advocates often portray the cryptocurrency as a store of value, but it’s been tracking equities recently, especially the Nasdaq, according to researcher Noelle Acheson. The tech-heavy index and Bitcoin’s price have each fallen over 5% in the past week.\n\n\"BTC is reminding us that it is seen as a risk asset by many,” Acheson wrote in a Telegram message to _Decrypt_ on Friday. “Risk sentiment is weak, largely due to uncertainty around the impact of tariffs and growing doubts, even among Fed officials, that rate cuts are coming any time soon.”\n\nMonday marks the end to what has been a tumultuous quarter for the crypto market. Bitcoin is on track to finish down 11% from the beginning of January, while Ethereum is slated to record a 45% fall, according to the crypto data provider [CoinGlass](https://www.coinglass.com/today).\n\n_Edited by James Rubin_\n\n### Daily Debrief Newsletter\n\nStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.\n\nYour Email\n\nGet it!\n\nGet it!\n\n### Recommended News\n\n- ![Source: Shutterstock](https://img.decrypt.co/insecure/rs:fit:3840:0:0:0/plain/https://cdn.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/japan-bitcon-japanese-yen-btc-gID_7.jpg@webp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## [Metaplanet Accelerates Bitcoin Buying Strategy, Issues $13.3 Million in New Bonds](https://decrypt.co/312459/metaplanet-accelerates-bitcoin-buying-strategy)\n\n\n\nJapan’s biggest Bitcoin treasury company, Metaplanet, has issued more debt to buy the cryptocurrency.\nThe firm, which trades on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, said Monday that it had issued a two billion yen ($13.3 million) zero-coupon ordinary bond to fund more Bitcoin buys.\nMetaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich made the announcement on X, saying the company—which is also an investment firm that owns a hotel—was “buying the dip.”\n\n押し目買い！Buying the dip! https://t.co/nOIQrAveap\n— Simon Gerovich (@gerovich)...\n\n- ![Elon Musk.
