A successful daily [candlestick](https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart/candlestick-patterns) close above the $2,000 mark could push the altcoin toward resistance at the lower boundary of the Fair Value Gap (FVG) at $2,533.\n\nThe rally to $2,533 would mark an over 30% gain from the current ETH price.\n\nTwo key momentum indicators, the RSI and MACD, support Ether’s recent gains. The RSI is sloping upward and reads 34, while the MACD shows an underlying positive momentum in Ethereum price trend.\n\n[![ETH/USDT](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/ETHUSDT_2025-03-17_19-04-33-638778183479525997.png)](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/ETHUSDT_2025-03-17_19-04-33-638778183479525997.png)\n\nETH/USDT daily price chart\n\nA failure to test the $2,000 level could imply weakness in Ether’s price trend and the nearly 16-month low at $1,754 could come into play as support.\n\n## XRP could rally 10%, shows signs of recovery\n\nXRP trades at $2.3386 at the time of writing on Monday. The [altcoin](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/sec-pumps-breaks-on-altcoin-etfs-institutional-interest-remains-202503150730) gained nearly 2% on the day, and the momentum indicators on the daily price chart support gains in XRP.\n\nThe 50% [Fibonacci](https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci) retracement of XRP’s decline from the peak of $3.40 to the February low of $1.7711 — at $2.5856 — is a key resistance for the altcoin. A rally to this level could mark 10% gains in XRP.\n\nThe RSI reads 48 and is sloping upward, while the MACD flashes green histogram bars above the neutral line.\n\n[![XRP](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/XRPUSDT_2025-03-17_19-15-20-638778184138187957.png)](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/XRPUSDT_2025-03-17_19-15-20-638778184138187957.png)\n\nXRP/USDT daily price chart\n\nIn the event of a flash crash in Bitcoin, altcoins like XRP and Ether could face a correction. XRP could find support at the multi-month low of $1.7711 if there is a serious decline in the altcoin’s price.\n\n## Expert commentary on where Bitcoin and Ethereum are headed\n\nRyan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, told [FXStreet](https://www.fxstreet.com/) that the recent Bitcoin pullback put the spotlight on the $82,000 and $85,000 support levels.\n\n> Lee said, “It’s a classic post-rally consolidation phase that is healthy but also a test of whether Bitcoin’s recent momentum has real staying power. Institutional buying and the buzz around a potential US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve continue to prop up sentiment, but with resistance looming near $85,000–$90,000, a breakout won’t come easy.\n>\n> Let’s not forget the macro wildcard: any unexpected FOMC moves could throw a wrench into the market. If sentiment turns bearish, we could see Bitcoin dip toward $75,000–$80,000, though a bullish macro backdrop could send it climbing back to $90,000.”\n\nObserving that [Ethereum](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/ethereum) and Bitcoin are tightly correlated and the altcoin tends to respond to shifts in the BTC price trend, Lee told FXStreet:\n\n> “The ETH/BTC ratio’s weakness suggests Ethereum is struggling to find independent strength, even with promising developments on the horizon. The Pectra upgrade and ongoing Layer 2 expansion give it a bullish long-term case, but in the short term, those fundamentals might not be enough to break resistance at $2,300–$2,500 without Bitcoin leading the charge. If market sentiment sours, ETH could slip to $1,800, but Ethereum could push toward the top of its range if BTC stages a recovery. Right now, it’s a waiting game—does Bitcoin hold the line, or does the market need a deeper reset before the next leg up?”\n\n* * *\n\nShare:Share on WhatsAppShare on TelegramCopy to clipboardCopied\n\nLinkedin\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nReddit\n\n[Email](mailto:?body=Bitcoin%C2%A0%28BTC%29%C2%A0daily%C2%A0price%C2%A0chart%C2%A0shows%C2%A0signs%C2%A0of%C2%A0recovery%C2%A0in%C2%A0the%C2%A0largest%C2%A0cryptocurrency.%C2%A0%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fxstreet.com%2Fcryptocurrencies%2Fnews%2Ftop-3-price-prediction-bitcoin-ethereum-ripple-btc-eth-xrp-gain-as-microstrategy-buys-107-million-btc-202503171431&subject=Top%203%20Price%20Prediction%20Bitcoin,%20Ethereum,%20Ripple:%20BTC,%20ETH,%20XRP%20gain%20as%20MicroStrategy%20buys%20$10.7%20million%20BTC)\n[Cryptos feed](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/feed)\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
