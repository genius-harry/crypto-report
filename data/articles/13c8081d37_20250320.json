The European Union’s recent retaliatory tariffs have caused uncertainty, affecting both crypto and traditional financial markets. Ether, in particular, has been in a steep decline since Dec. 16, 2024, when it peaked above $4,100. It has since lost over 53% of its value. Analysts from Bitfinex attributed the drop to macroeconomic concerns and the Ethereum network’s high transaction fees discouraging new projects. “A lack of new projects or builders moving to ETH, primarily due to high operating fees, is likely the principal reason behind the lackluster performance of ETH,” the analysts\nsaid\n.\nThe broader crypto market has also been affected, with Bitcoin and other assets experiencing a sell-off. Many traders are hesitant due to fears about the economic impact of ongoing trade disputes. While ETH’s decline is partially due to external factors, internal network issues have also played a role. The Ethereum network has seen reduced developer activity, which has weakened investor confidence.\nAdding to the downward pressure, U.S. spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have struggled, recording net negative outflows for four consecutive weeks.\nData\nfrom Sosovalue shows that investors pulled more than $119 million from these ETFs last week alone. The lack of inflows limits ETH’s chances of a price rebound, further straining the market.\nThe incident has once again highlighted the risks of leveraged trading. While borrowing funds can amplify potential gains, it also increases exposure to severe losses. Even small price fluctuations can trigger large liquidations, as seen in this case. Market analysts believe ETH’s next key level to watch is $1,800, which could serve as a strong support or another breaking point.\nWith global economic uncertainty continuing and crypto markets already under pressure, traders are approaching investments cautiously.
