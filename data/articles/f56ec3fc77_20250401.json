is currently down about 4% on the day at a current price of $83,736. It's down just 0.4% on the week, but the Friday slide has cooled rising momentum seen in recent days.\n\nOther top coins have shown sharper losses over the past day, however, with Ethereum down 6% to $1,875 and XRP falling about 7% to $2.17.

Long positions make up the bulk of the carnage at $402 million, and Ethereum is the biggest contributor to liquidations with $136 million worth in total. Bitcoin is next at $118 million.\n\nBoth the Dow and S&P 500 indices are down more than 2% Friday, with traders reacting to continued inflation fears and the impact of Trump's ever-evolving trade tariffs on other nations.

similarly rattled by [hotter-than-expected inflation data](https://decrypt.co/312110/bitcoin-price-altcoins-inflation-february).\n\nThe price of Bitcoin dipped to $83,609 early Friday afternoon, and is currently down about 4% on the day at a current price of $83,736. It's down just 0.4% on the week, but the Friday slide has cooled rising momentum seen in recent days.\n\nOther top coins have shown sharper losses over the past day, however, with Ethereum down 6% to $1,875 and XRP falling about 7% to $2.17. Both fell to weekly lows on Friday alongside Bitcoin.\n\n![Bitcoin](https://img.decrypt.co/insecure/rs:fit:3840:0:0:0/plain/https://cdn.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bitcoin.png@webp)\n\nBTC\n\n-4.13%$83,039.95\n\n* * *\n\n24H7D1M1YMAX\n\nCreated with Highcharts 10.3.38:00AM4:00PMMar 268:00AM4:00PMMar 278:00AM4:00PMMar 288:00AM4:00PMMar 298:00AM4:00PMMar 308:00AM4:00PMMar 318:00AM4:00PMApr 1$82000$84000$86000$88000$80000$90000\n\n[Price data by](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin?utm_source=decrypt-web&utm_medium=partnership&utm_campaign=coin_price_chart_widget)\n\n[BTC price](https://decrypt.co/price/bitcoin)\n\nSolana and Dogecoin are also in the red Friday, down 6% and 4.5% respectively over the past day, though both coins remain up over the last week.\n\nAmid the declines, crypto liquidations have surged over the past day, tallying more than $450 million as of this writing per data from [CoinGlass](https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData). Long positions make up the bulk of the carnage at $402 million, and Ethereum is the biggest contributor to liquidations with $136 million worth in total. Bitcoin is next at $118 million.\n\nBoth the Dow and S&P 500 indices are down more than 2% Friday, with traders reacting to continued inflation fears and the impact of Trump's ever-evolving trade tariffs on other nations. The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) [rose 0.4% in February](https://decrypt.co/312110/bitcoin-price-altcoins-inflation-february), as reported Friday—a higher market than expected and the biggest monthly leap in more than a year.\n\n![Inflation is here.

is currently down about 4% on the day at a current price of $83,736. It's down just 0.4% on the week, but the Friday slide has cooled rising momentum seen in recent days.\n\nOther top coins have shown sharper losses over the past day, however, with Ethereum down 6% to $1,875 and XRP falling about 7% to $2.17. Both fell to weekly lows on Friday alongside Bitcoin.\n\n![Bitcoin](https://img.decrypt.co/insecure/rs:fit:3840:0:0:0/plain/https://cdn.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bitcoin.png@webp)\n\nBTC\n\n-4.13%$83,039.95\n\n* * *\n\n24H7D1M1YMAX\n\nCreated with Highcharts 10.3.38:00AM4:00PMMar 268:00AM4:00PMMar 278:00AM4:00PMMar 288:00AM4:00PMMar 298:00AM4:00PMMar 308:00AM4:00PMMar 318:00AM4:00PMApr 1$82000$84000$86000$88000$80000$90000\n\n[Price data by](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin?utm_source=decrypt-web&utm_medium=partnership&utm_campaign=coin_price_chart_widget)\n\n[BTC price](https://decrypt.co/price/bitcoin)\n\nSolana and Dogecoin are also in the red Friday, down 6% and 4.5% respectively over the past day, though both coins remain up over the last week.\n\nAmid the declines, crypto liquidations have surged over the past day, tallying more than $450 million as of this writing per data from [CoinGlass](https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData). Long positions make up the bulk of the carnage at $402 million, and Ethereum is the biggest contributor to liquidations with $136 million worth in total. Bitcoin is next at $118 million.\n\nBoth the Dow and S&P 500 indices are down more than 2% Friday, with traders reacting to continued inflation fears and the impact of Trump's ever-evolving trade tariffs on other nations.
