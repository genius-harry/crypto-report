Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased, FOMC statement read. \"The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.\"\n\nAdditionally, the institution also announced plans to\nslow the pace of its balance sheet runoff starting in April, adding another\nlayer of complexity to its monetary policy approach. The Fed’s latest economic projections now see U.S. GDP growing just 1.7%\nin 2025, down from the 2.1% forecast in December.\n\nGrowth estimates for 2026 and 2027 were also trimmed,\nreflecting growing uncertainty about the economic trajectory. “As with real activity and [inflation](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/inflation/), the outlook for\nthe future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable\nuncertainty,” the Fed stated, hinting at concerns over trade policies and other\nglobal economic risks.\n\n## Economic Growth and Inflation\n\nDespite economic headwinds, the Fed’s projections suggest policymakers still anticipate ending 2025 with a benchmark interest rate of 3.9%, implying only two rate cuts by year-end. The forecasts for 2026 and 2027 stand at 3.4% and 3.1%, respectively, reinforcing expectations that borrowing costs will remain elevated in the near term.\n\n![](https://images.financemagnates.com/images/Crypto%20reacts%20as%20Fed%20holds%20interest%20rates%20steady.jpg_id_198c4006-fdeb-4079-bfcf-0815895a4a9b_size900.jpg)\n\nCrypto reacts as Fed holds interest rates steady\n\nIn December, the central bank [forecast inflation at 2.5% for 2025 and GDP growth at 2.1%](https://www.financemagnates.com/trending/can-bitcoin-hold-100k-price-drops-as-fed-slashes-rates-again/). Given recent economic data, there is\nspeculation that the Fed may raise its inflation outlook while lowering its\ngrowth expectations.\n\nWith uncertainty surrounding economic growth,\ninflation, and future rate moves, the FOMC's latest meeting is now shaping investor sentiment. For crypto traders, the short-term volatility might\nbe significant, but in the broader context of digital asset markets, it remains\nbusiness as usual.\n\nThe Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate steady\nfor a second consecutive meeting, signaling concerns about slower economic\ngrowth and persistent inflation pressures.

Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased, FOMC statement read. \"The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.\"\n\nAdditionally, the institution also announced plans to\nslow the pace of its balance sheet runoff starting in April, adding another\nlayer of complexity to its monetary policy approach. The Fed’s latest economic projections now see U.S. GDP growing just 1.7%\nin 2025, down from the 2.1% forecast in December.\n\nGrowth estimates for 2026 and 2027 were also trimmed,\nreflecting growing uncertainty about the economic trajectory. “As with real activity and [inflation](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/inflation/), the outlook for\nthe future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable\nuncertainty,” the Fed stated, hinting at concerns over trade policies and other\nglobal economic risks.\n\n## Economic Growth and Inflation\n\nDespite economic headwinds, the Fed’s projections suggest policymakers still anticipate ending 2025 with a benchmark interest rate of 3.9%, implying only two rate cuts by year-end. The forecasts for 2026 and 2027 stand at 3.4% and 3.1%, respectively, reinforcing expectations that borrowing costs will remain elevated in the near term.\n\nCrypto reacts as Fed holds interest rates steady\n\nIn December, the central bank [forecast inflation at 2.5% for 2025 and GDP growth at 2.1%](https://www.financemagnates.com/trending/can-bitcoin-hold-100k-price-drops-as-fed-slashes-rates-again/). Given recent economic data, there is\nspeculation that the Fed may raise its inflation outlook while lowering its\ngrowth expectations.\n\nWith uncertainty surrounding economic growth,\ninflation, and future rate moves, the FOMC's latest meeting is now shaping investor sentiment. For crypto traders, the short-term volatility might\nbe significant, but in the broader context of digital asset markets, it remains\nbusiness as usual.\n\nTopics\n\n\n[bitcoin](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/bitcoin/) [Ethereum](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/ethereum/) [federal reserve](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/federal-reserve/)\n\nShare this article\n\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Bitcoin%2C%20Ethereum%2C%20XRP%20Surge%20As%20Fed%20Holds%20Interest%20Rates%20Steady&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F&hashtags=finance_magnates,fm&via=finance_magnates)\n\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F&title=Bitcoin%2C%20Ethereum%2C%20XRP%20Surge%20As%20Fed%20Holds%20Interest%20Rates%20Steady&summary=The%20Fed%20highlighted%20the%20concerns%20about%20slower%20economic%20growth%20and%20persistent%20inflation%20pressures.%0AAmid%20the%20announcement%2C%20cryptocurrencies%20market%20surged%2C%20with%20XRP%20leading%20by%20double-digit%20growth%20in%20the%20past%20day.)\n\n[Email](mailto:?subject=You%27re%20going%20to%20love%20it%3A%20Bitcoin%2C%20Ethereum%2C%20XRP%20Surge%20As%20Fed%20Holds%20Interest%20Rates%20Steady&body=Check%20out%20this%20article%20from%20Finance%20Magnates%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F)\n\n[Telegram](https://t.me/share/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F&text=Bitcoin%2C%20Ethereum%2C%20XRP%20Surge%20As%20Fed%20Holds%20Interest%20Rates%20Steady)\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F)\n\n[WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F)\n\n[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F&title=Bitcoin%2C%20Ethereum%2C%20XRP%20Surge%20As%20Fed%20Holds%20Interest%20Rates%20Steady)\n\nDisqus Comments\n\nWe were unable to load Disqus.

For crypto traders, the short-term volatility might\nbe significant, but in the broader context of digital asset markets, it remains\nbusiness as usual.\n\nTopics\n\n\n[bitcoin](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/bitcoin/) [Ethereum](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/ethereum/) [federal reserve](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/federal-reserve/)\n\nShare this article\n\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Bitcoin%2C%20Ethereum%2C%20XRP%20Surge%20As%20Fed%20Holds%20Interest%20Rates%20Steady&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F&hashtags=finance_magnates,fm&via=finance_magnates)\n\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F&title=Bitcoin%2C%20Ethereum%2C%20XRP%20Surge%20As%20Fed%20Holds%20Interest%20Rates%20Steady&summary=The%20Fed%20highlighted%20the%20concerns%20about%20slower%20economic%20growth%20and%20persistent%20inflation%20pressures.%0AAmid%20the%20announcement%2C%20cryptocurrencies%20market%20surged%2C%20with%20XRP%20leading%20by%20double-digit%20growth%20in%20the%20past%20day.)\n\n[Email](mailto:?subject=You%27re%20going%20to%20love%20it%3A%20Bitcoin%2C%20Ethereum%2C%20XRP%20Surge%20As%20Fed%20Holds%20Interest%20Rates%20Steady&body=Check%20out%20this%20article%20from%20Finance%20Magnates%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F)\n\n[Telegram](https://t.me/share/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F&text=Bitcoin%2C%20Ethereum%2C%20XRP%20Surge%20As%20Fed%20Holds%20Interest%20Rates%20Steady)\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F)\n\n[WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F)\n\n[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F&title=Bitcoin%2C%20Ethereum%2C%20XRP%20Surge%20As%20Fed%20Holds%20Interest%20Rates%20Steady)\n\nDisqus Comments\n\nWe were unable to load Disqus.
