They do so to achieve operational efficiencies and speedier,around-the-clock settlements.\n\nJust in the past weeks, asset manager Fidelity Investments [filed to launch](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/03/22/fidelity-files-for-onchain-u-s-treasury-fund-joining-the-asset-tokenization-race) a tokenized money market fund and is reportedly working on [issuing a stablecoin](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/03/26/fidelity-investments-prepares-to-unveil-its-own-stablecoin-ft).\n\nDerivatives exchange CME Group [started tokenization tests](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/03/25/derivatives-trading-giant-cme-group-to-test-tokenization-with-google-cloud) with Google Cloud with plans to launch new services next year, while the New York Stock Exchange's parent company [partnered](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/03/27/nyse-parent-to-explore-stablecoins-tokenized-funds-with-circle-for-financial-services) with Circle to explore services built on USDC stablecoin and tokenized fund USYC.\n\nArchax specializes in the issuance, custody, and trading of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), including money market funds, corporate bonds, carbon credits and uranium. For example, Archax's recently-issued tokenized Treasury fund on XRP Ledger with asset manager Abrdn saw $45 million in deposits to become a top 10 product by assets under management, [rwa.xyz data](https://app.rwa.xyz/treasuries) shows.\n\nArchax has been exploring entering the U.S. market over the past years, but stayed on the sideline due to regulatory uncertainty, Graham Rodford, CEO of Archax, said in an interview with CoinDesk.\n\n\"Under this new administration, which seems to be more crypto positive, we are getting more interest from the U.S. as well, which obviously we can't easily serve from the UK, so it makes sense for us strategically to go there,\" Rodford said.\n\nArchax also plans to expand its offerings to tokenized U.S. equities and bonds, building on its existing partnerships across several blockchains including Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Hedera Hashgraph and XRP Ledger.\n\nThe firm's U.S. entrance follows the recent [purchase of a Spanish brokerage firm](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/10/31/archax-to-buy-spanish-broker-king-shaxson-capital-markets-to-expand-in-europe) to expand services to the European Union, pending regulatory approvals.\n\n[Tokenized Assets](/tag/tokenized-assets)[Real World Assets ](/tag/real-world-assets)[Broker-Dealers](/tag/broker-dealers)[Exclusive ](/tag/exclusive)[acquisition](/tag/acquisition)\n\n##### [Krisztian Sandor](/author/krisztian-sandor)\n\nKrisztian Sandor is a U.S. markets reporter focusing on stablecoins, tokenization, real-world assets.

That's the least since May 2020, when ether was trading around $200 and bitcoin just under $10,000. Today the ETH price is about $1,800 and the BTC price around $82,000.\n\nTristan Thompson on Reclaiming Financial Freedom With Crypto\n\nMore Videos\n\n0 seconds of 19 minutes, 3 secondsVolume 0%\n\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\n\nShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?\n\nPlay/PauseSPACE\n\nIncrease Volume\u2191\n\nDecrease Volume\u2193\n\nSeek Forward\u2192\n\nSeek Backward\u2190\n\nCaptions On/Offc\n\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreenf\n\nMute/Unmutem\n\nDecrease Caption Size-\n\nIncrease Caption Size\\+ or =\n\nSeek %0-9\n\nBitcoin\u2019s $200T Future: CoinDesk Spotlight with Michael Saylor\n\n1:59:53\n\nLive\n\n00:05\n\n18:58\n\n19:03\n\nStory continues\n\nDon't miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Long & Short Newsletter today. [See all newsletters](/newsletters)\n\nSign me up\n\nBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our [terms of use](/terms) and [privacy policy](/privacy).\n\nThe underperformance is notable because it's the first time ether has weakened against bitcoin in the 12 months after a [BTC reward halving](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/04/20/bitcoin-blockchain-has-fourth-halving-in-15-year-history-in-show-of-monetary-policy-set-by-code). On April 20, 2024, the payment Bitcoin miners received for confirming blocks on the blockchain was reduced by 50% to 3.125 BTC.\n\nIn previous halving cycles, ether outperformed bitcoin in the first year after a halving. This time, the ratio has dropped by more than 50%.\n\nThat's partly because the threat of a tariff-driven trade war, persistent inflation and elevated bonds yields globally have driven investors to assets seen as more liquid and less risky. Gold, the ultimate haven, has climbed to record highs, and in the cryptocurrency market bitcoin is seen as a safer bet than ether.\n\nThis relative performance also marks one of ether\u2019s worst quarterly performances against bitcoin in several years, according to data from Glassnode. The last time ether underperformed bitcoin to a similar degree was in the third quarter of 2019, when the ratio dropped to 0.0164, a quarterly decline of 46%.\n\n![ETH/BTC Quarterly Price Performance \\(Glassnode\\)](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2F6bea5b7c99c20cbd8dad2cbd8bf1def1b760a35e-3200x1800.png%3Fauto%3Dformat&w=3840&q=75)\n\nThis current slump mirrors the underperformance seen in 2019 and further highlights ether's relative weakness, especially when compared to other [layer-1 assets](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/05/crypto-investors-why-you-need-to-understand-layer-1-protocols/). The SOLETH ratio \u2014 measuring the value of Solana\u2019s [SOL](https://www.coindesk.com/price/solana/) relative to ether \u2014 is up 24% year-to-date to 0.07007. This indicates that SOL has significantly outperformed ether in 2025, despite the token itself itself being down 35% year-to-date.\n\n_**UPDATE (March 31, 9:25 UTC):** Adds macroeconomic environment in fifth paragraph._\n\n[Ether](/tag/ether)[Bitcoin](/tag/bitcoin)[Halving](/tag/halving)[Markets](/tag/markets)\n\n##### [James Van Straten](/author/james-van-straten)\n\nJames Van Straten is a Senior Analyst at CoinDesk, specializing in Bitcoin and its interplay with the macroeconomic environment.

Core Scientific (CORZ) follows with a 14% weighting and a 48% decline, while Cipher Mining (CIFR), the third-largest holding at 9.6%, is down 52%. Even NVIDIA (NVDA), the sixth-largest holding at 5%, has dropped over 20% this year.\n\nTristan Thompson on Reclaiming Financial Freedom With Crypto\n\nMore Videos\n\n0 seconds of 19 minutes, 3 secondsVolume 0%\n\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\n\nShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?\n\nPlay/PauseSPACE\n\nIncrease Volume\u2191\n\nDecrease Volume\u2193\n\nSeek Forward\u2192\n\nSeek Backward\u2190\n\nCaptions On/Offc\n\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreenf\n\nMute/Unmutem\n\nDecrease Caption Size-\n\nIncrease Caption Size\\+ or =\n\nSeek %0-9\n\nBitcoin\u2019s $200T Future: CoinDesk Spotlight with Michael Saylor\n\n1:59:53\n\nLive\n\n00:05\n\n18:58\n\n19:03\n\nStory continues\n\nDon't miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today.

Several gold mining ETFs rank in the top five, with the Equity World Basic Materials DAXglobal Gold Miners ETF up 38% year-to-date.\n\nBitcoin miners have faced significant challenges this year, as the network hash rate\u2014representing the computational power required to mine bitcoin\u2014continues to climb, hovering near all-time highs around 832 EH/s. This has created a notable divergence between bitcoin\u2019s price and the hash rate.\n\nAs a result, mining difficulty has also remained close to its peak, making it harder for miners to successfully mine new bitcoins. At the same time, transaction fees are extremely low, further squeezing miner profitability as rewards from processing transactions remain minimal.\n\n[Mining](/tag/mining)[Bitcoin ETF](/tag/bitcoin-etf)[WGMI](/tag/wgmi)\n\n##### [James Van Straten](/author/james-van-straten)\n\nJames Van Straten is a Senior Analyst at CoinDesk, specializing in Bitcoin and its interplay with the macroeconomic environment.

unusual twist on the increasingly popular strategy of holding bitcoin as a corporate reserve.\n\nDominari Holdings (DOMH), located in the Trump Tower in New York City, made

The stock has a market cap of about $70 million and has fallen more than 9% on Friday's trading.\n\nMost companies that adopt a bitcoin reserve strategy buy the cryptocurrency outright and self-custody it or use a custodian. Dominari is instead gaining exposure through a regulated exchange-traded fund, a move that may appeal to firms looking for easier compliance and cleaner accounting.\n\nThe move isn\u2019t surprising, given Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s interest in crypto. The president\u2019s son is involved in many crypto projects and has become an unofficial spokesperson for his father\u2019s enthusiasm.\n\nJust earlier this week, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the financial protocol backed by President Donald Trump and his family, [pitched its own stablecoin](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/03/26/trump-tied-world-liberty-financial-pitches-its-stablecoin-in-washington-with-don-jr) at a crypto event in Washington.\n\n[Bitcoin Treasury Reserve Asset](/tag/bitcoin-treasury-reserve-asset)[Trump](/tag/trump)\n\n##### [Helene Braun](/author/helene-braun)\n\nHelene is a New York-based news reporter at CoinDesk, covering news about Wall Street, the rise of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and updates on crypto exchanges.
