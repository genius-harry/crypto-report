IREN (IREN) is the largest holding at 15%, which is down 42%. Core Scientific (CORZ) follows with a 14% weighting and a 48% decline, while Cipher Mining (CIFR), the third-largest holding at 9.6%, is down 52%.

Several gold mining ETFs rank in the top five, with the Equity World Basic Materials DAXglobal Gold Miners ETF up 38% year-to-date.\n\nBitcoin miners have faced significant challenges this year, as the network hash rate\u2014representing the computational power required to mine bitcoin\u2014continues to climb, hovering near all-time highs around 832 EH/s. This has created a notable divergence between bitcoin\u2019s price and the hash rate.\n\nAs a result, mining difficulty has also remained close to its peak, making it harder for miners to successfully mine new bitcoins. At the same time, transaction fees are extremely low, further squeezing miner profitability as rewards from processing transactions remain minimal.\n\n[Mining](/tag/mining)[Bitcoin ETF](/tag/bitcoin-etf)[WGMI](/tag/wgmi)\n\n##### [James Van Straten](/author/james-van-straten)\n\nJames Van Straten is a Senior Analyst at CoinDesk, specializing in Bitcoin and its interplay with the macroeconomic environment.

The first time that's happened.\n\n![ETH/BTC Ratio Performance Since Bitcoin Halving \\(Glassnode\\)](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2F79a746448215f50bee7a95f8c872242e4f174876-3200x1800.png%3Fauto%3Dformat&w=3840&q=75)\n\n#### What to know:\n\nEther ([ETH](https://www.coindesk.com/price/ethereum/)) has dropped 39% this year relative to bitcoin ([BTC](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/)), the largest cryptocurrency, taking the ratio between the two to the lowest in almost five years as a riskier macroeconomic environment weighs on the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nAt the current level, 1 ETH is the equivalent of 0.02191 BTC. That's the least since May 2020, when ether was trading around $200 and bitcoin just under $10,000. Today the ETH price is about $1,800 and the BTC price around $82,000.\n\nTristan Thompson on Reclaiming Financial Freedom With Crypto\n\nMore Videos\n\n0 seconds of 19 minutes, 3 secondsVolume 0%\n\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\n\nShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?\n\nPlay/PauseSPACE\n\nIncrease Volume\u2191\n\nDecrease Volume\u2193\n\nSeek Forward\u2192\n\nSeek Backward\u2190\n\nCaptions On/Offc\n\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreenf\n\nMute/Unmutem\n\nDecrease Caption Size-\n\nIncrease Caption Size\\+ or =\n\nSeek %0-9\n\nBitcoin\u2019s $200T Future: CoinDesk Spotlight with Michael Saylor\n\n1:59:53\n\nLive\n\n00:05\n\n18:58\n\n19:03\n\nStory continues\n\nDon't miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today.

On April 20, 2024, the payment Bitcoin miners received for confirming blocks on the blockchain was reduced by 50% to 3.125 BTC.\n\nIn previous halving cycles, ether outperformed bitcoin in the first year after a halving. This time, the ratio has dropped by more than 50%.\n\nThat's partly because the threat of a tariff-driven trade war, persistent inflation and elevated bonds yields globally have driven investors to assets seen as more liquid and less risky. Gold, the ultimate haven, has climbed to record highs, and in the cryptocurrency market bitcoin is seen as a safer bet than ether.\n\nThis relative performance also marks one of ether\u2019s worst quarterly performances against bitcoin in several years, according to data from Glassnode. The last time ether underperformed bitcoin to a similar degree was in the third quarter of 2019, when the ratio dropped to 0.0164, a quarterly decline of 46%.\n\n![ETH/BTC Quarterly Price Performance \\(Glassnode\\)](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2F6bea5b7c99c20cbd8dad2cbd8bf1def1b760a35e-3200x1800.png%3Fauto%3Dformat&w=3840&q=75)\n\nThis current slump mirrors the underperformance seen in 2019 and further highlights ether's relative weakness, especially when compared to other [layer-1 assets](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/05/crypto-investors-why-you-need-to-understand-layer-1-protocols/). The SOLETH ratio \u2014 measuring the value of Solana\u2019s [SOL](https://www.coindesk.com/price/solana/) relative to ether \u2014 is up 24% year-to-date to 0.07007. This indicates that SOL has significantly outperformed ether in 2025, despite the token itself itself being down 35% year-to-date.\n\n_**UPDATE (March 31, 9:25 UTC):** Adds macroeconomic environment in fifth paragraph._\n\n[Ether](/tag/ether)[Bitcoin](/tag/bitcoin)[Halving](/tag/halving)[Markets](/tag/markets)\n\n##### [James Van Straten](/author/james-van-straten)\n\nJames Van Straten is a Senior Analyst at CoinDesk, specializing in Bitcoin and its interplay with the macroeconomic environment.
