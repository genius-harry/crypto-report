The first time that's happened.\n\n![ETH/BTC Ratio Performance Since Bitcoin Halving \\(Glassnode\\)](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2F79a746448215f50bee7a95f8c872242e4f174876-3200x1800.png%3Fauto%3Dformat&w=3840&q=75)\n\n#### What to know:\n\nEther ([ETH](https://www.coindesk.com/price/ethereum/)) has dropped 39% this year relative to bitcoin ([BTC](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/)), the largest cryptocurrency, taking the ratio between the two to the lowest in almost five years as a riskier macroeconomic environment weighs on the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nAt the current level, 1 ETH is the equivalent of 0.02191 BTC. That's the least since May 2020, when ether was trading around $200 and bitcoin just under $10,000. Today the ETH price is about $1,800 and the BTC price around $82,000.\n\nTristan Thompson on Reclaiming Financial Freedom With Crypto\n\nMore Videos\n\n0 seconds of 19 minutes, 3 secondsVolume 0%\n\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\n\nShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?\n\nPlay/PauseSPACE\n\nIncrease Volume\u2191\n\nDecrease Volume\u2193\n\nSeek Forward\u2192\n\nSeek Backward\u2190\n\nCaptions On/Offc\n\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreenf\n\nMute/Unmutem\n\nDecrease Caption Size-\n\nIncrease Caption Size\\+ or =\n\nSeek %0-9\n\nBitcoin\u2019s $200T Future: CoinDesk Spotlight with Michael Saylor\n\n1:59:53\n\nLive\n\n00:05\n\n18:58\n\n19:03\n\nStory continues\n\nDon't miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto for Advisors Newsletter today.

On April 20, 2024, the payment Bitcoin miners received for confirming blocks on the blockchain was reduced by 50% to 3.125 BTC.\n\nIn previous halving cycles, ether outperformed bitcoin in the first year after a halving. This time, the ratio has dropped by more than 50%.\n\nThat's partly because the threat of a tariff-driven trade war, persistent inflation and elevated bonds yields globally have driven investors to assets seen as more liquid and less risky. Gold, the ultimate haven, has climbed to record highs, and in the cryptocurrency market bitcoin is seen as a safer bet than ether.\n\nThis relative performance also marks one of ether\u2019s worst quarterly performances against bitcoin in several years, according to data from Glassnode. The last time ether underperformed bitcoin to a similar degree was in the third quarter of 2019, when the ratio dropped to 0.0164, a quarterly decline of 46%.\n\n![ETH/BTC Quarterly Price Performance \\(Glassnode\\)](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2F6bea5b7c99c20cbd8dad2cbd8bf1def1b760a35e-3200x1800.png%3Fauto%3Dformat&w=3840&q=75)\n\nThis current slump mirrors the underperformance seen in 2019 and further highlights ether's relative weakness, especially when compared to other [layer-1 assets](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/05/crypto-investors-why-you-need-to-understand-layer-1-protocols/). The SOLETH ratio \u2014 measuring the value of Solana\u2019s [SOL](https://www.coindesk.com/price/solana/) relative to ether \u2014 is up 24% year-to-date to 0.07007. This indicates that SOL has significantly outperformed ether in 2025, despite the token itself itself being down 35% year-to-date.\n\n_**UPDATE (March 31, 9:25 UTC):** Adds macroeconomic environment in fifth paragraph._\n\n[Ether](/tag/ether)[Bitcoin](/tag/bitcoin)[Halving](/tag/halving)[Markets](/tag/markets)\n\n##### [James Van Straten](/author/james-van-straten)\n\nJames Van Straten is a Senior Analyst at CoinDesk, specializing in Bitcoin and its interplay with the macroeconomic environment.

Then the internet said it needs to be the Department of Government Efficiency. I was like Internet is right,\u201d he added.\n\nDOGE prices are down 3.5% in the past 24 hours, in line with a broader market drop. While there have been no firm plans to include the token in the controversial non-governmental agency, its introduction in August had sparked several namesake tokens and birthed the start of a multi-month rally in dogecoin.\n\nThe official site even sported [a dogecoin logo](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/01/21/u-s-doge-sports-dogecoin-logo-after-announcement-at-trump-inauguration) for a few hours on the day after Trump\u2019s inauguration, giving more credence to rumors of the joke token playing a role in the new agency.\n\nD.O.G.E seeks to make government spending of taxpayer money more efficient while streamlining departments that handle spending. It has saved an estimated $130 billion after a formal start in January, [data shows](https://doge.gov/savings), with an average $840 saving for taxpayers.\n\n[musk](/tag/musk)[Elon Musk](/tag/elon-musk)[DOGE](/tag/doge)\n\n##### [Shaurya Malwa](/author/shaurya-malwa)\n\nShaurya is the Co-Leader of the CoinDesk tokens and data team in Asia with a focus on crypto derivatives, DeFi, market microstructure, and protocol analysis.

Several gold mining ETFs rank in the top five, with the Equity World Basic Materials DAXglobal Gold Miners ETF up 38% year-to-date.\n\nBitcoin miners have faced significant challenges this year, as the network hash rate\u2014representing the computational power required to mine bitcoin\u2014continues to climb, hovering near all-time highs around 832 EH/s. This has created a notable divergence between bitcoin\u2019s price and the hash rate.\n\nAs a result, mining difficulty has also remained close to its peak, making it harder for miners to successfully mine new bitcoins. At the same time, transaction fees are extremely low, further squeezing miner profitability as rewards from processing transactions remain minimal.\n\n[Mining](/tag/mining)[Bitcoin ETF](/tag/bitcoin-etf)[WGMI](/tag/wgmi)\n\n##### [James Van Straten](/author/james-van-straten)\n\nJames Van Straten is a Senior Analyst at CoinDesk, specializing in Bitcoin and its interplay with the macroeconomic environment.

In contrast, safe-haven assets like gold reached an all-time high, and U.S. Treasury yields dropped due to increased demand.\n\nGlobally, portfolio managers are adopting cautious strategies, either reducing risk or avoiding large investments, unsettled by the impending \"reciprocal tariffs\" and their potential economic toll.\n\nElsewhere in crypto, data from [Tokenomist.ai](https://tokenomist.ai/emission/crypto-market) shows that $751.2 million in unlocks are scheduled this week, including SUI and DYDX, putting the weekly unlock cycle in the middle of the pack. Unlocks are scheduled to pick up in May, when roughly $4.4 billion (at current market prices) in tokens will be unlocked.\n\n##### [Shaurya Malwa](/author/shaurya-malwa)\n\nShaurya is the Co-Leader of the CoinDesk tokens and data team in Asia with a focus on crypto derivatives, DeFi, market microstructure, and protocol analysis.
