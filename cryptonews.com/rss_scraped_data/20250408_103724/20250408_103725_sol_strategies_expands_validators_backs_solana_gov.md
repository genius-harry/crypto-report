The publicly traded Canadian firm [released](https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/247578/SOL-Strategies-Provides-Monthly-Operational-Update-March-2025) its operational update for last month on April 7, highlighting a month defined by strategic expansion, infrastructure upgrades, and governance involvement.

## SOL Strategies Expands Stake Through Validator Acquisitions

The company’s most transformative move was [acquiring three prominent Solana validators](https://cryptonews.com/news/sol-strategies-acquires-three-solana-validators-including-laine-and-stakewiz-com/), including the highly respected Laine validator and the validator analytics platform Stakewiz.com.

The $24 million transaction was finalized on March 17 and marked a 102% increase in the company's total SOL stake, which now stands at 3,351,617 SOL (approximately $388 million).

Accompanying the acquisition was the addition of Laine’s founder, Michael Hubbard, to SOL Strategies’ executive team as Chief Strategy Officer.

Hubbard, known for his technical expertise in the [Solana ecosystem](https://cryptonews.com/tags/solana-ecosystem/), is now spearheading the expansion of validator infrastructure and high-value institutional partnerships.

The validator acquisition also introduced key performance enhancements. 

SOL Strategies reported 99.955% uptime across all validators and delivered an average APY of 7.41% to delegators, outperforming the network average.

## Key Validators Align Behind SIMD-228, but Proposal Falls Short

Beyond validator operations, the company actively participated in the [vote on SIMD-228](https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-community-rejects-simd-0228-in-historic-vote-as-small-validators-sway-outcome/), a pivotal proposal to reduce Solana’s inflation rate from 4.5% to 0.87%.

SOL Strategies publicly confirmed that all its validators voted in favor of the proposal.

While the proposal secured 61.4% support, it fell short of the two-thirds threshold needed for adoption.
