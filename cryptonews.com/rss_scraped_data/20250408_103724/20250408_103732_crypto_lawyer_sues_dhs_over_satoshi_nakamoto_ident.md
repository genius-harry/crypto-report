A prominent crypto lawyer has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in an effort to uncover what the agency may know about the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of [Bitcoin](https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/).

James Murphy, known on social media platform X as “MetaLawMan,” filed the complaint in a Washington D.C. District Court. 

[The lawsuit,](https://www.schaerr-jaffe.com/wp-content/uploads/1-Compl_.pdf) which was filed on April 7, seeks to compel DHS to release documents under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). 

It is centered on claims made by a DHS special agent in 2019 that the agency had identified and interviewed the person or persons behind Bitcoin.

The filing references statements made by DHS Special Agent Rana Saoud at the 2019 Offshore Alert Conference, a gathering focused on financial intelligence and investigations.

During her presentation, Saoud reportedly stated that the department had located the creator of Bitcoin and that the individual was not acting alone but was part of a group of four people. 

According to Murphy, Saoud said DHS agents interviewed these individuals in California, where they explained how Bitcoin works and why it was created.

To date, DHS has never publicly confirmed or denied the claims or disclosed any supporting documentation. 

In his legal challenge, Murphy is requesting access to interview notes, internal emails, and any other records related to the alleged meeting with Nakamoto and his collaborators.

In a post on X, Murphy [wrote](https://x.com/metalawman/status/1909239183337734206?s=46&t=4avIdU6fZvwW6O9_9GsSaQ), “The Great Mystery of the 21st Century—Who is Bitcoin Creator ‘Satoshi Nakamoto?’ The United States Government claims to know the answer—but isn’t talking. So, today I sued the U.S. Government to find out exactly what it knows.”

Murphy is being represented by former Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Field, an attorney experienced in FOIA litigation. He emphasized that the case is not about speculation but about seeking documented truth. 

“If the interview really happened as the DHS agent claimed, there should be documentation of the substance of that meeting,” Murphy said.

He also suggested that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem should voluntarily disclose the requested information to support the government’s transparency efforts. 

“It is entirely possible that the DHS agent was mistaken and DHS did not interview the real Satoshi,” Murphy added. “If DHS resists disclosure, I will pursue the case to conclusion to solve this mystery.”

A DHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The identity of [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://cryptonews.com/tags/satoshi-nakamoto/) has remained one of the most enduring mysteries in cryptocurrency. Since Bitcoin's whitepaper was released in 2008 and the first block was mined in 2009, speculation has ranged from individuals to groups and even intelligence agencies. 

The potential unmasking of Nakamoto has long divided the crypto community. Some see it as a long-overdue revelation, while others warn that it could damage Bitcoin's decentralized ethos.

The legal case now puts new pressure on a U.S. government agency to either confirm or deny whether it holds information that could end the search for Bitcoin’s enigmatic creator.

## Satoshi Turns 50 Amid Identity Clues

As the mystery around Satoshi Nakamoto deepens, April 5, 2025, marked what many believe to be the Bitcoin creator’s 50th birthday, based on a birthdate [listed on their archived P2P Foundation profile](https://web.archive.org/web/20120529203623/https://p2pfoundation.ning.com/profile/SatoshiNakamoto). 

The milestone comes as legal and public pressure intensifies to uncover Nakamoto’s identity.

A flurry of attempts over the years, from speculation around cryptographers to wild theories involving intelligence agencies, have all yielded no definitive answers. 

However, Coinbase’s Conor Grogan [recently suggested](https://x.com/jconorgrogan/status/1887154636190093696) that Kraken may hold KYC data linked to Satoshi’s past exchange activity via CaVirtEx, a Canadian platform acquired in 2016.

As the crypto community awaits the outcome of new legal action, Bitcoin’s origin remains an unresolved chapter in its history.
