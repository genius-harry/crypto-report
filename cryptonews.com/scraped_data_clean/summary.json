Which Crypto Narratives Stood Out in February 2025? 11. What to Expect in March February was a challenging month for the crypto market, often described as a \u201cbloodbath.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at what happened to altcoins during this period. ## Sonic Grew 162% in February, While the Market Declined Sonic (S) served as a safe haven for some traders while most of the crypto market was in decline. Although the rebranding from Fantom (FTM) took place in January 2025, the coin attracted most of its attention in February. While the broader market saw one of its deepest corrections, Sonic\u2019s price increased. S traded at $0.37 on Feb. 3 before rising sharply. By Feb. 21, it had reached $0.97, the highest price of the month. This marks a 162% price increase. Sonic also became the fastest-growing decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol by TVL among the top 20. In February, its total value locked grew by 134% to $676.5 million. ## Why Is Sonic Price Growing? Experts Weigh In Tim Delhaes, CEO and co-founder of Grindery, believes Sonic\u2019s growth is driven by its positioning as a utility-focused project rather than a meme coin: > The January rebrand (ex-Fantom) and mainnet launch reignited hype, backed by real growth: TVL +172%, top-tier DeFi revenue, and 10K+ TPS scalability. Unlike meme pumps, Sonic\u2019s betting on utility, drawing inevitable Solana comparisons (especially post-meme coin drama). Julian Beltran, CTO and co-founder of Stabolut, also sees the rebranding as a key factor behind Sonic\u2019s rise: > The rebrand wasn\u2019t just a name change\u2014it came with serious tech upgrades that boosted speed and cut costs. This, coupled with eye-popping performance stats and some savvy market moves, caught investors\u2019 attention big time. According to Julian Beltran, this transformation gave the former Fantom network a second wind, attracting developers and potential partners: > Sonic\u2019s ecosystem expanded rapidly, drawing in developers with attractive incentives and forging key partnerships. All this buzz translated into real numbers: the price jumped from $0.37 to $0.97 in a month\u2014a whopping 162% gain. ## Mantra Price Doubled in February Mantra (OM) was one of the top performers among the top 100 coins by market cap. In February, OM rose from $4.64 (the month\u2019s lowest price on Feb. 3) to an all-time high (ATH) of $8.99 on Feb. 23. The Mantra price increased by 93.75% in February. Mantra is part of the Real World Assets (RWA) sector and ranks second in market cap at $6.8 billion. Chainlink (LINK) holds the top spot with $8.8 billion, while Ondo (ONDO) is third with $2.9 billion. ## What\u2019s Next for Mantra? Price Prediction and Outlook Mantra has emerged as one of the top-performing RWA coins and a leader in the broader crypto market. The question remains whether OM\u2019s price can sustain this trend in March. Julian Beltran told Cryptonews that several factors have contributed to Mantra\u2019s price surge: > They\u2019ve formed partnerships with companies like Google Cloud and DAMAC Group. Their blockchain is designed with regulations in mind. They\u2019ve also received $11 million in funding. The market for tokenized assets, where Mantra operates, is currently valued at $38 billion. Tim Delhaes also shared his perspective with Cryptonews, emphasizing Mantra\u2019s strong track record: > MANTRA\u2019s RWA vision is paying off. Their $500M Dubai real estate deal and $1B partnership with DAMAC scream institutional validation. With asset tokenization being \u2018the next-gen markets\u2019 (BlackRock\u2019s words, not mine), OM isn\u2019t just hype\u2014it\u2019s fundamentals. ## New Altcoins: Story Rises in the Crypto Market Story (IP) began trading on crypto exchanges on Feb. 14 at $1. During February, the coin reached new all-time highs multiple times. The latest increase occurred on Feb. 26, when the price rose to $7.31. In nearly two weeks, IP grew by 631%, while the rest of the crypto market declined. Story outperformed Mantra but did not become the fastest-growing coin of February since it only started trading mid-month. ## Analyst Sees Story\u2019s Long-Term Prospects as \u2018Solid\u2019 Tim Delhaes outlined several factors behind the sharp rise in IP\u2019s price in February following its mainnet launch and exchange listings: > Post-mainnet, Story\u2019s IP token rebounded fast, doubling from its lows and hitting the AI coin narrative hard. New exchange listings, tokenized IP rights, and strong social buzz fueled the surge. A little profit-taking hit, but the long-term vision? Solid. Anastasija Plotnikova, CEO and co-founder of Fideum, told Cryptonews that AI integration also contributed to Story\u2019s momentum: > Story Protocol\u2019s $IP token surged after launching its mainnet, making on-chain IP management easier, while a16z\u2019s $140M backing and AI-driven marketing fueled the hype. A crypto trader and analyst known as LaCryptoLuycos also sees IP as one of the strongest altcoins on the market. > $IP is one of the strongest altcoins, showing resilience during market downturns without a significant correction. The price action appears to be moving organically. > > The chart shows an ascending channel, with the price respecting both the upper and lower trendlines. The recent\u2026 pic.twitter.com/o3m7JTj4QY\n> > \u2014 LaCryptoLycus\ud83d\udc3a (@CryptoLycus) March 3, 2025 ## DeFi Blue Chips Ranked Among the Biggest Losers in February Lido DAO (LDO), Aave (AAVE), and Ethena (ENA) led the declines in February. Despite being among the top 10 decentralized finance protocols by Total Value Locked (TVL), these projects could not withstand the market downturn. As Tim Delhaes emphasized, this month has been \u201cbrutal\u201d for blue-chip DeFi, though he remains optimistic about their future: > Even with Aave pulling $67M in fees and Lido leading ETH staking, panic-selling took over. Ethena\u2019s March 5 unlock (66% of supply) fueled an epic $12M whale dump. Fundamentals are solid, but in this market, liquidity rules. Market\u2019s shaky, but we could argue that real utility is winning. ## Jito Overtakes Uniswap and Solana in Fees and Revenue In recent months, Solana has typically ranked among the top five in fees and revenue. However, in February 2025, it dropped to sixth place. At the same time, Jito, a liquid staking protocol, took third place despite a significant decline over the month. Uniswap ranked fifth in fees, though revenue data is unavailable. This is notable as Jito is part of the Solana ecosystem, which has faced reputational issues due to meme coin scams. Jito generates less revenue than Solana, as it is limited to liquid staking, while Solana operates across multiple sectors. Tim Delhaes sees Jito as one of the key players in the passive yield sector this year: > Solana\u2019s Jito is making history\u2014its fees even surpassed Solana\u2019s own L1 fees. With $261M YTD revenue (second only to Tether) and 3.6B SOL locked, liquid staking isn\u2019t slowing down. It\u2019s 2025\u2019s hottest passive yield play\u2014and the numbers prove it. This suggests that liquid staking could emerge as a key narrative in crypto and remains a trend to watch. Anastasija Plotnikova believes that the market\u2019s shift toward liquid staking may have contributed to the decline of blue-chip DeFi projects: > Jito\u2019s rising fees reflect the growing appeal of liquid staking in a slow market, as users look for flexible yield opportunities. On the flip side, DeFi blue chips like Lido, Aave, and Ethena have been hit hard, dropping over 40% in a month, likely due to low trading volumes and investors rotating into hotter narratives like liquid staking and RWAs. ## Which Crypto Narratives Stood Out in February 2025? While liquid staking is emerging as a potential safe source of income during market turbulence, other sectors have also gained attention. All crypto narratives ended in red in February due to the overall market correction. However, some sectors saw smaller declines, including centralized exchanges (CEXs), lending, and RWAs. Among the worst-performing sectors were Decentralized science (DeSci), Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and GameFi. This aligns with broader market trends. During corrections, traders seek safer sectors. BNB (BNB) is the largest coin in the CEX category, with a market cap of $82.9 billion. Its price remained relatively stable compared to the broader downturn. Lending protocols, which provide crypto borrowing options, are widely used in DeFi for liquidity. When markets decline, investors often turn to safer assets like stablecoins. Lending platforms offer relatively high yields on stablecoin deposits, making them attractive during volatility. One example is Maker (MKR), which rose by 105.44% in February, from $864 to $1,775. RWAs remain a promising sector, bridging cryptocurrencies with traditional finance. This sector has shown growth, partly driven by Mantra. Analysts interviewed by Cryptonews also support this view. ## What to Expect in March March will be a key test for altcoins after February\u2019s volatility, with investors watching whether recovering sectors like RWAs and liquid staking can sustain momentum. DeFi blue chips may struggle unless liquidity improves, while projects tied to trending narratives could see renewed interest. Sonic and Mantra, which outperformed the market last month, will need strong fundamentals to maintain their gains. Story\u2019s growth could continue if AI-related hype persists, but profit-taking remains a risk. Overall, market sentiment will likely hinge on Bitcoin\u2019s price action and macroeconomic factors influencing risk assets.

A Month of Mixed Signals and Looming Decisions ## What Is Bitcoin? Bitcoin (BTC) is a decentralized cryptocurrency created to function as a digital currency and means of payment that operates independently of any single individual, organization, or authority, eliminating the need for third-party intermediaries in financial transactions. It is allocated to blockchain miners to validate transactions and can be purchased through various exchanges. Unveiled to the public in 2009 by an enigmatic developer or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has become the most widely recognized cryptocurrency in the world. Its success has spurred the creation of numerous other cryptocurrencies. ## Bitcoin Price Slumps 8.6% in August Bitcoin (BTC) price showed volatility in August 2024. The month began with a price of $65,264 on Aug. 1, but quickly dipped to $51,329 by Aug. 5, representing a decline of 21% in five days. This downward trend reversed, with the price climbing back up to $64,387 on Aug. 23. However, BTC\u2019s price closed out the month at $59,845, which represents a 8.6% month-over-month drop. Bitcoin\u2019s downtrend prompted analysts at 10x Research to forecast a potential drop to the low $50,000 range. According to Markus Thielen, an analyst at the firm, the cryptocurrency\u2019s price has broken below the ascending trendline of an asymmetrical triangle, suggesting a retest of the Aug. 5 low. This breakdown could lead to a price drop below $50,000. Source: Markus Thielen Additionally, miner behavior played a significant role in market sentiment. Glassnode data revealed that miners have been accumulating Bitcoin since Aug. 15, indicating confidence in the long-term value of the cryptocurrency. However, with the price lingering below $60,000, there is a rising concern that miners might be compelled to sell to offset operational costs. This potential sell pressure is fueling a bearish outlook for Bitcoin. Bitcoin\u2019s August performance was also influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors. Trader DamiDefi noted on X that the U.S. recession narrative has stabilized, shifting the focus to monetary policy and the strength of the U.S. dollar. A bullish outlook for Bitcoin hinges on expectations of looser Federal Reserve policy, such as lower interest rates. Traders anticipate that the U.S. may be forced to implement expansionary measures to stimulate the economy. Investors also piled into U.S. government bonds as a safe haven, with the 2-year Treasury yield falling. This reflects concerns about the labor market, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.3% in July and 4.2% in August. While inflation has eased, the risk of further job losses may limit the potential for a major rate cut. > The bottom of #Bitcoin may be in\n> > There's a new bullish narrative for Bitcoin driven by looser Federal Reserve policy and global macro trends. > > After a bearish phase in early August, expectations of the Fed easing monetary policy, such as lowering interest rates, have boosted\u2026 pic.twitter.com/PpE9dOOnwx\n> > \u2014 Dami-Defi (@DamiDefi) September 3, 2024 Another factor contributing to the weak performance of Bitcoin in August and early September was the continued outflows from spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Bitcoin ETFs struggled to attract significant inflows last month, drawing negative attention and raising doubts about their investment appeal. Bitcoin\u2019s open interest (OI), a measure of the total value of outstanding derivative contracts, experienced a notable decline in August, as per data from Coinglass. OI stood at $35.11 billion on Aug. 1, but fell to $30.17 billion on Sept. 1, a decrease of 14%. Bitcoin\u2019s open interest in August. Source: Coinglass Declining OI during a period of sideways price movement often indicates that more short positions are being opened. This bearish sentiment was further supported by several days of negative funding rates in August. ## Bitcoin On-Chain Activity Presents a Mixed Bag Bitcoin\u2019s on-chain metrics in August 2024 presented a mixed picture. While the network saw a surge in new addresses and a record-breaking daily transaction volume, the overall number of transactions and active wallets declined slightly compared to the previous month. On-chain volume experienced a minor dip, dropping from $1.45 trillion in July to $1.44 trillion in August, a 0.7% decrease. This slight decline could be attributed to various factors, such as fluctuations in Bitcoin\u2019s price or changes in user activity. Transaction volume on the Bitcoin network reached a new peak in August. After a sharp 33% drop in the number of transactions, from over 711k on July 25 to 475k on Aug. 9 (based on the 7-day moving average), the volume rebounded significantly, hitting a record high of 731k on Aug. 26. Despite this surge, the total number of transactions for the month fell by 5%, decreasing from 19.51 million in July to 18.55 million in August. In August 2024, the number of transactions on Bitcoin reached 18.55 million. Source: The Block Active wallet usage also experienced a surge in early August, peaking at 751k on Aug. 6 (based on the 7-day moving average). However, this growth began to wane as the month progressed, with the count declining to 673k on Aug. 26. The total number of active wallets decreased 3% from July to 21.8 million wallets in August. Daily active addresses on Bitcoin over the last 3 months (7DMA). Source: The Block When analyzing Bitcoin\u2019s on-chain metrics over a longer period, it becomes clear that network activity has significantly decreased in recent months, mirroring the sideways price action. CryptoQuant\u2019s data shows a drop in daily active addresses, indicating less overall network usage. At its peak in mid-March, coinciding with Bitcoin\u2019s recent all-time high, daily active addresses (on average) hovered around 1.2 million. Since then, this number has shrunk to a recent low of 673k in late August, which is the lowest number of daily active addresses since 2021. This decline in active addresses reflects less overall interest in using the Bitcoin network, which translates into fewer transactions taking place, possibly due to the extended period of stagnant price action. However, Bitcoin\u2019s ability to attract new addresses remained strong. In August, 9.43 million new addresses were added to the network, an increase of 4.5% compared to July. New addresses on Bitcoin over the last 3 months (7DMA). Source: The Block According to a Santiment X post, the number of Bitcoin wallets holding at least 100 BTC hit a 17-month high in August, surpassing 283 wallets. This increased whale activity could be a positive sign for the market, as significant whale buying has often preceded new all-time highs for Bitcoin. > \ud83d\udc33 As crypto prices have let retail traders down, Bitcoin whales are growing in number. A net gain of +283 wallets holding at least 100 BTC has emerged in just 1 month. The now 16,120 such wallets on the network has broken a 17-month high. pic.twitter.com/DcAU0W01Pk\n> > \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) August 31, 2024 Santiment also reported that wallets holding at least 10 Bitcoin (\u201csharks\u201d) have been actively accumulating coins as well. Another positive sign is the steadily declining supply of Bitcoin reserves on centralized exchanges, suggesting that traders are increasingly holding onto their BTCs rather than selling them. As of Aug. 31, centralized crypto exchanges held approximately 2.62 million Bitcoin, a significant 12% decrease from the 3.01 million Bitcoin held on Jan. 1, per data from CryptoQuant. In September, Bitcoin reserves are continuing to decline, hitting an annual low of 2.57 million on Sept. 15. These numbers suggest that traders are either moving their Bitcoin to cold storage or using it for other purposes, such as staking or decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. If this trend continues and demand for Bitcoin remains strong, the cryptocurrency could be poised for further price increases in the coming weeks. Bitcoin reserve on exchanges, YTD. Source: CryptoQuant ## Bitcoin ETFs Face Headwinds U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a slowdown in net inflows during August and the early days of September. While the month started with a modest weekly outflow of $80.69 million on Aug. 2, inflows picked up in the following two weeks, reaching $32.59 million for the week of Aug. 9-16 and $506.37 million for the week of Aug. 17-23. However, this positive momentum reversed sharply in the last days of August and the first week of September, with significant outflows totaling $983.31 million between Aug. 24 and Sept. 6. The cumulative inflow for Bitcoin ETFs as of Sept. 13 reached $17.30 billion, according to SoSoValue data. Daily total Bitcoin ETF flows (Aug. 1 \u2013 Sept. 13). Source: SoSoValue However, according to CryptoQuant, these inflows in August are now just a fraction of their March levels. Analysts emphasize the importance of strong institutional demand through Bitcoin ETFs to drive Bitcoin\u2019s price to new all-time highs. BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) appears to be the most successful Bitcoin ETF to date, with the highest total inflows of $20.91 billion as of Sept. 13. On Aug. 26, IBIT recorded its highest net inflow in 35 days, totaling $224.1 million on that day. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) comes in second with $9.64 billion in inflows. ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) takes third place with total inflows of $2.356 billion. Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) has seen relatively small inflows of $380 million, while Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has experienced the most significant outflows, totaling -$20.04 billion. According to K33 Research, 1,199 professional firms held investments in Bitcoin ETFs, marking an increase of 262 firms over Q2. > Institutional ownership of BTC ETFs grew solidly in Q2! > > According to 13F filings, 1,199 professional firms held investments in U.S. spot ETFs as of June 30, marking an increase of 262 firms over the quarter.\n> > While retail investors still hold the majority of the float,\u2026 pic.twitter.com/YanrZpfcCG\n> > \u2014 Vetle Lunde (@VetleLunde) August 16, 2024 Asset managers Goldman Sachs, Capula Management and Avenir Tech emerged as the top buyers of Bitcoin ETFs in Q2 2024, according to a CoinShares Research report from Aug. 20. These three investment firms collectively purchased nearly $1.3 billion worth of BTC ETF shares. ### Crypto ETFs Dominate 2024 ETF Launches Crypto ETFs have made a significant impact on the ETF market in 2024. According to Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, crypto ETFs accounted for 13 of the 25 largest ETF launches of the year based on year-to-date inflows. Of the approximately 400 new ETFs launched in 2024, the top four largest by inflows are all spot Bitcoin ETFs. > I have a very simple take on the adoption of spot btc ETFs\u2026\n> > Out of nearly 430 ETFs launched this yr, *all 10* new spot btc ETFs are in the top 35 (8%) by inflows.\n> > Including the top 4 overall.\n> > And 7 of top 20.\n> > You simply don't put up these numbers w/out advisors allocating. pic.twitter.com/htIAtOc5Xd\n> > \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) September 9, 2024 ### Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs Surpass $250 Million in AUM Spot Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong achieved a significant milestone in August, surpassing HK$2 billion ($256 million) in assets under management (AUM). According to SoSo Value, Hong Kong\u2019s Bitcoin ETFs saw total net inflows of $259.24 million, bringing their holdings to 4.47K Bitcoin. This growth in Hong Kong\u2019s Bitcoin ETF market indicates increasing investor interest in Bitcoin and the potential for further expansion in the region. ### Nasdaq Aims to Launch Bitcoin Index Options Nasdaq, the U.S. stock exchange, announced on Aug. 27 that it plans to launch options based on a Bitcoin index to provide institutions and traders with additional tools to hedge their Bitcoin exposure. These options would allow traders to buy or sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price on a specified date, providing a valuable tool for hedging risk and expanding purchasing power. The proposed index options would be based on the CME CF Bitcoin Real-Time Index, which tracks Bitcoin futures and options contracts traded on the CME Group exchange. However, this financial instrument is still subject to approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). ### SEC Delays Decision on Carbon-Offset Bitcoin ETF The SEC postponed (once again) a decision on the listing of an ETF that combines spot Bitcoin and carbon credit futures. Tidal Investments, the issuer of the ETF, filed the fund\u2019s S-1 registration in December 2023, and NYSE Arca filed its initial 19b-4 filing in March. The SEC initially delayed a decision on the ETF in May, and the deadline has now been extended to Nov. 21. If approved, the 7RCC Spot Bitcoin and Carbon Credit Futures ETF would track a portfolio consisting of 80% Bitcoin and 20% carbon credit futures. ### Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Acquires Osprey Bitcoin Trust The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) is set to expand its assets under management by $120 million through the acquisition of the Osprey Bitcoin Trust (OBTC). In a joint statement released on Aug. 27, Bitwise Asset Management and Osprey Funds announced an asset purchase agreement. As part of the deal, OBTC unitholders will receive shares of BITB in exchange for their OBTC shares. The transaction is expected to close later this year, subject to certain conditions. Osprey Funds launched its OBTC on the OTC market in February 2021. The fund has been available to U.S. investors with a management fee of 0.49%. ## Bitcoin Miners Face Economic Hardships Competition and costs for miners are rising, leading to August 2024 being the worst month for miner profitability in a year. To adapt, some miners are exploring alternative revenue streams, while others are acquiring existing operations to boost their hashrate. ### Bitcoin Miners See Worst Revenues The Bitcoin network\u2019s hashrate, a measure of its computing power, reached a new all-time high of over 742 exahashes per second (EH/s). This surge in hashrate, as recorded on Sept. 2, reflects a steady increase since 2021, primarily driven by the adoption of more powerful mining hardware like application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Bitcoin network\u2019s hashrate. Source: CryptoQuant As the Bitcoin network\u2019s hashrate increases, mining becomes more competitive and expensive. Miners are forced to invest in more powerful hardware, expand their operations, and consume more energy to maintain profitability. This rising cost has put a strain on the mining industry. The combination of increased hashrate and high difficulty rates has directly impacted miner revenue. August 2024 was the most challenging month for miners since September 2023, with revenues plunging to a low of $827.56 million, down more than 10.5% from July\u2019s $927.35 million. Bitcoin miner revenue in USD. Source: Blockchain.com The number of Bitcoin mined in August (13,843 BTC) was slightly lower than the previous month\u2019s total of 14,725 BTC. This decline in mining revenue was primarily driven by falling transaction volumes and a significant increase in mining difficulty following the Bitcoin halving in April. The halving event reduced block rewards by 50% to 3.125 BTC, further squeezing miner profitability. Meanwhile, Bitcoin miners have been selling their Bitcoin holdings through exchanges, but this selling pressure started to ease in August, according to data from CryptoQuant. As miner reserves begin to stabilize, there are signs of a shift towards accumulation. Bitcoin miner reserves. Source: CryptoQuant However, the low profitability of Bitcoin mining remains a concern. If miners feel compelled to sell their holdings to cover costs, it could lead to increased selling pressure and impact Bitcoin\u2019s price. ### Mining Industry Adapts to Challenges A recent August report published by Bernstein highlighted the financial challenges facing Bitcoin miners. The report revealed that miners were facing a revenue squeeze due to multiple factors, including reduced block subsidies and increased energy costs. To address these financial pressures, many mining companies \u2013 IREN (formerly known as Iris Energy), Hut8, Hive Digital Technologies or Core Scientific \u2013 are exploring alternative strategies and shifting focus toward the artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) data center market. According to investment firm VanEck, by utilizing their computing power and physical facilities for data processing, mining companies can generate additional revenue streams to compensate for potential shortfalls in mining profits. > \u201cIf AI/HPC comprises 20% of these miners\u2019 energy capacity by 2027, and assuming they could fund the investment, we think the publicly traded bitcoin miners\u2019 total additional yearly profits could exceed an average of $13.9 billion per year over 13 years.\u201d AI/HPC strategies and estimated upside potential among publicly traded Bitcoin miners (2024). Source: VanEck Cash-rich mining companies like Riot Platforms and Cleanspark expanded their operations by acquiring other miners with established facilities. This allows them to increase their near-term hashrate and secure additional mining capacity. Other mining firms are exploring renewable energy sources to maintain competitiveness in the challenging mining landscape. MARA, formerly known as Marathon Digital, has been experimenting with landfill-gas-to-energy systems, which convert methane gas from landfills into usable electricity. This approach aligns with the growing trend of sustainable mining practices. All of these strategies reflect the mining industry\u2019s ability to adapt to new challenges in the Bitcoin mining business. ### TeraWulf to Launch New Bitcoin Mining Facility TeraWulf, the world\u2019s sixth-largest Bitcoin mining firm, announced plans to launch a new mining facility at the end of September. Additionally, the company is exploring a potential partnership with one of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d tech giants \u2013 Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. Additionally, TeraWulf plans to diversify its operations into high-performance computing and AI data centers. The company is constructing a new facility at its Lake Mariner site, allocating 2 megawatts of power for its initial foray into data center services. > TeraWulf's Strategy: > > \u26cf\ufe0f Engineering the perfect synergy between #Bitcoin mining and #AI #HPC > \u26cf\ufe0f doing it using majorly #zerocarbon energy > \u26cf\ufe0f doing it vertically integrated > \u26cf\ufe0f while maximizing profits every step of the way#NotAllHashCreatedEqual #WULFDoesItBest pic.twitter.com/utXzsPjm5o\n> > \u2014 TeraWulf (@TeraWulfInc) August 23, 2024 ### Bitfarms Expands Operations with New Data Center and Acquisition On Aug. 27, Bitcoin mining company Bitfarms took ownership of its newest data center in Sharon, Pennsylvania. This marks the company\u2019s first mega-site in the United States with access to up to 120 megawatts of power capacity. Bitfarms has already acquired the necessary equipment and plans to bring 30 megawatts of capacity online by the end of 2024. The company is also exploring the possibility of leasing an additional 10-megawatt site, potentially expanding its total site capacity to 120 megawatts in 2025. > We are pleased to announce that Bitfarms has assumed control of its newest data center in Sharon, Pennsylvania.\n> > \u2013 Closed on 110 MW > \u2013 30 MW expected online by YE 2024 > \u2013 LOI signed for additional 10 MW\n> > To learn more, see the full details here: #Bitcoin\u2026 pic.twitter.com/bwmKRGSYrl\n> > \u2014 Bitfarms (@Bitfarms_io) August 27, 2024 Additionally, on Aug. 21, Bitfarms announced the acquisition of Stronghold Digital Mining for approximately $125 million, including assumed debt of $50 million.

In August, Riot Platforms expanded its holdings in Bitfarms. According to a regulatory filing on Aug. 13, Riot acquired an additional 1 million Bitfarms common shares, increasing its total ownership to 18.9%. This move follows a previous attempt by Riot to acquire Bitfarms in May. Riot had offered $950 million for Bitfarms, but the proposal was rejected by the company. Riot\u2019s increased stake in Bitfarms could potentially influence the Canadian mining firm\u2019s future direction and strategic decisions. ### Rhodium Enterprises Files for Bankruptcy Bitcoin mining firm Rhodium Enterprises filed for voluntary bankruptcy under Chapter 11 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. The company reported liabilities of up to $100 million in its bankruptcy filing on Aug. 24. The filing includes six subsidiaries: Rhodium Encore, Jordan HPC, Rhodium JV, Rhodium 2.0, Rhodium 10MW, and Rhodium 30MW. The company\u2019s estimated total assets range between $100 million and $500 million, while its debts fall within the range of $50 million to $100 million. This bankruptcy case highlights the financial challenges facing some Bitcoin mining companies, as the industry continues to navigate a volatile market and rising operational costs. ## Bitcoin Ecosystem Booms, Adoption Takes Off The Bitcoin ecosystem continues to experience significant growth and innovation across various sectors. ### 21.co Launches Bitcoin Wrapper on Ethereum 21.co, the company behind cryptocurrency asset manager 21Shares, launched its own version of a wrapped Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain. This new token, called 21.co Wrapped Bitcoin (21BTC), was announced on Sep. 3 and joins 21.co\u2019s existing suite of wrapped tokens for Avalanche (AVAX), Polkadot (DOT), and Solana (SOL) on Ethereum. 21.co\u2019s launch of a Bitcoin wrapper comes at a time when the leading existing wrapper, Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), is facing criticism over its custodian BitGo\u2019s proposed partnership with BiT Global. This partnership would grant the Hong Kong-based crypto exchange partial custody of the wBTC\u2019s underlying Bitcoin holdings. This decision sparked concerns within the community regarding the security and transparency of wBTC. With over $9.1 billion in market capitalization according to CoinMarketCap, wBTC is the most popular BTC wrapper. However, the potential involvement of a lesser-known exchange in its custody has shaken investor confidence. ### El Salvador to Train 80,000 Government Employees in Bitcoin The National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) of El Salvador is set to provide Bitcoin training and certifications to 80,000 government employees.

The round was co-led by Hack VC and Castle Island Ventures. The project initially aimed to raise $4 million but surpassed its target, attracting significant interest from various investors. ### Runes Transactions Slip as Bitcoin Dominance Grows While Bitcoin has regained its network dominance, daily Runes transactions have declined over the past two months, averaging around 50,000 per day. After its launch in April, the Runes protocol initially led in daily transactions. However, Bitcoin has steadily gained ground and now accounts for approximately 90% of network activity. The remaining 10% is split between Ordinals, BRC-20 tokens and Runes. In late August, Runes transactions experienced a brief spike, reaching 32% and 28% of network activity on Aug. 23 and 28, respectively. This increase was short-lived, however, as the percentage dropped back to 3% by Sept. 1. Daily share between transaction types on the Bitcoin network.

While the price dipped below $60,000 and miner profitability faced challenges, positive signs emerged from ecosystem growth, institutional adoption, and innovative financial products. The near-term price direction of Bitcoin depends on a confluence of factors. Macroeconomic factors, particularly U.S. monetary policy decisions, are likely to play a critical role. A potential pivot towards an easier monetary policy by the Federal Reserve could incentivize investors to seek riskier assets such as Bitcoin. Despite a decline in some metrics, the continued influx of new addresses reflects continued investor interest. However, revitalized network usage is critical for a sustained price increase. The emergence of new financial products, such as BTCz and Babylon\u2019s staking protocol could open up additional utilities for Bitcoin, potentially attracting a broader user base. Selling pressure from miners has eased, possibly indicating a shift towards accumulation. However, the long-term viability of mining with rising costs requires close monitoring. The slowdown in Bitcoin ETF inflows also needs to be addressed. Regulatory clarity and increased participation from large asset managers could rekindle institutional interest and push the Bitcoin price to new highs.

Transaction fees remained stable at $34.7 million, a slight 0.3% uptick from December. ## Ethereum Top Gainers and Losers in January In January 2025, Ethereum-based altcoins saw significant price fluctuations driven by market sentiment and ecosystem developments. Some tokens experienced impressive rallies due to increased adoption and new protocol upgrades, while others struggled with declining liquidity and investor sell-offs. The competition among Layer 2 solutions and DeFi projects also influenced price action, with certain coins outperforming the broader market.

While these were met with mixed feelings, this was undoubtedly a moment for the history books. Aside from the official presidential coins, here are the top gainers and losers of the month. ## Solana News \u2013 January 2025 Highlights ### Cboe BZX Exchange Resubmits Filings for Four Asset Managers Eyeing Solana ETF Listing in US The move follows the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) rejection of their previous filings late last year. ### Sol Strategies Entered OTC Group Best Market Under the Ticker \u201cCYFRF\u201d Sol Strategies upgrades to OTCQX Best Market, enhancing U.S. investor access and increasing transparency. ### Solana Developers Propose New Hashing System to Address Scalability Challenges The proposal, titled SIMD-215, introduces a lattice-based homomorphic hashing function. ## What to Look for in February\u2019s Key Events and Crypto Report Here\u2019s a list of key macroeconomic events/metrics in February 2025 that could affect crypto: * Consensus Hong Kong Summit (Feb 18-20): Hong Kong hosts one of the largest crypto conferences, aiming to attract 10,000 attendees as it positions itself as a global digital asset hub. * MiCA takes effect (Q1 2025): The EU\u2019s landmark crypto regulation is now in force, impacting global crypto exchanges and stablecoins like Tether (USDT), which may face trading restrictions in the EU due to non-compliance. The crypto market in 2025 is expected to see significant changes driven by technological advancements and regulatory decisions. The approval of spot Solana ETFs in the U.S. could significantly boost the Solana price. In addition, AI-powered crypto trading is expected to become a major trend, with AI bots potentially outperforming human investors in terms of efficiency and market insight. However, there are also challenges to consider. AI-powered scams are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and crypto investors need to be aware of these threats. The new administration in the U.S. is expected to foster a more innovation-friendly crypto regulatory environment. Increased institutional and governmental crypto adoption is also on the horizon, fueled by potential advancements like a U.S. Bitcoin Reserve Act. Finally, the change in SEC leadership under Paul Atkins also rekindled hopes for greater regulatory clarity and a potential resolution to the SEC\u2019s case against Ripple. However, before jumping on the bull train, crypto investors should carefully consider the current economic landscape.
