# Ethereum Reclaims No. 1 Spot as Leading DEX Chain for First Time Since September, Overtakes Solana

## The shift in leadership occurred amidst a bearish market sentiment, particularly within the memecoin sector.

![Ethereum was March's top blockchain by DEX volumes. \(artellliii72/Pixabay\)](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2Fbfedd0a7cc14687c6756b466235d043b502ce2aa-1280x853.jpg%3Fauto%3Dformat&w=3840&q=75)

#### What to know: 

Last month, Ethereum reclaimed its title as the leading smart contract blockchain for decentralized exchange (DEX) trading, as the market swoon dampened activity on Solana, the go-to platform for memecoin traders.

Ethereum-based DEXes registered an industry-leading cumulative trading volume of $64.616 billion in March, beating Solana's tally of $52.62 billion by 22%, according to data source [DefiLama](https://defillama.com/dexs/chains). That's the first time since September that Ethereum topped the charts, pushing Solana to the number two spot.

![Top blockchains by DEX trading volumes. \(DefiLlama\)](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2F99f08502abdbf962367d33967e99c97a87624956-2008x963.png%3Fauto%3Dformat&w=3840&q=75)

The change in leadership happened as the total crypto market capitalization fell 4.2% to $2.63 trillion, extending February's 20% loss, as macroeconomic uncertainty and disappointment over the lack of fresh BTC purchases in the U.S. strategic reserve saw bitcoin slip below $80,000.

The bearish market sentiment dampened speculation across the broader landscape, especially within the memecoin sector, as reflected in the significant decline in activity on Raydium, the leading Solana-based DEX and a hotspot for meme trading in late 2024.

Throughout March, Raydium [did not log](https://defillama.com/protocol/raydium?volume=true&tvl=false) a single day with trading volume exceeding $1 billion, highlighting a considerable decrease from its record-high of $13 billion on Jan. 18, DefiLlama data show.

Additionally, daily volume on the Solana-based memecoin launch pad [averaged ](https://defillama.com/protocol/pump?volume=true&groupBy=daily)less than $100 million in March, down significantly from the peak of $390 million in mid-January. Activity on Solana-based DEXes peaked with the debut of President Donald Trump's TRUMP token in January.

Meanwhile, Ethereum's outperformance was driven by Uniswap, which [achieved](https://defillama.com/dexs/chains/ethereum) over $30 billion in trading volume, with Fluid taking the distant second spot with $9 billion in activity.

Still, Ethereum's ether token fell over 18% to $1,822 in March, registering bigger losses than Solana's SOL token, which fell by 15.8%, per data source TradingView and CoinDesk.

[Per observers](https://x.com/nic__carter/status/1905722880484348104), ether's inflationary tokenomics and the growing popularity of Layer 2 solutions, which supposedly siphon activity from the main chain, are responsible for ether's poor performance.
