**Teucrium Investment Advisors is set to launch its Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF (XXRP) after securing NYSE Arca approval. This marks the first exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States to offer leveraged exposure to XRP (XRP).**

The move comes as the race for a spot XRP ETF intensifies in the US, with Polymarket odds suggesting a high likelihood of approval this year.

## What Is Teucrium’s 2x Long XRP ETF and Why It Matters

The XXRP fund aims to deliver two times (2x) the[ daily price performance of the altcoin](https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-are-altchains). It will begin trading on [NYSE Arca](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1683471/000114336225000105/XXRP040725.pdf) on April 8.

According to its prospectus, the [fund will not directly invest in XRP](https://beincrypto.com/why-retail-investors-prefer-xrp-over-bitcoin/). Instead, it will primarily gain exposure through swap agreements with global financial institutions. 

There is also a provision for investment in XRP futures contracts, options, XRP-related companies,[ and spot XRP ETPs as needed](https://beincrypto.com/learn/xrp-etf-guide/). Additionally, the fund may utilize reverse repurchase agreements to enhance its investment capital.

> “The fund presents different risks than other types of funds. The fund uses leverage and is riskier than similarly benchmarked funds that do not use leverage. The fund is intended to be used as a short-term trading vehicle,” the [prospectus](https://teucrium.com/assets/pdfs/XXRP_Prospectus.pdf) read.

The ETF enables [investors to access the XRP market](https://beincrypto.com/xrp-price-down-as-long-term-holders-selling-rises/) with a lower capital investment compared to buying equivalent derivatives directly. It has a management fee of 1.85% and offers monthly distributions to investors.

The launch of XXRP comes at a pivotal moment for XRP, as [Ripple recently settled its legal battle with the SEC.](https://beincrypto.com/sec-return-fine-in-ripple-xrp-lawsuit/) Despite the lack of an approved spot ETF, Teucrium’s leveraged product offers a new avenue for investors seeking amplified exposure to the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. [According to BeInCrypto data](https://beincrypto.com/price/ripple/), XRP’s market cap stands at $111 billion.

Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas commented on the development in the latest X (formerly Twitter post). He highlighted the unusual nature of this launch.

> “Very odd (maybe a first) that a new asset’s first ETF is leveraged,” he [said](https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1909364066088263883).

Balchunas also noted that while a spot XRP ETF has yet to be approved, the odds of such approval remain high. Many in the industry share this sentiment.

Interestingly, in anticipation of the XXRP launch, the likelihood of a spot XRP ETF receiving approval has surged.[ According to the prediction market platform Polymarket,](https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-use-polymarket/) odds have jumped by 5% since yesterday. 

The chances of approval by December 2025 now stand at 75%. However, the outlook for a short-term approval by July 31 remains more cautious, with odds currently sitting at just 33%.

It is worth noting that[ the SEC faces a critical deadline in October](https://beincrypto.com/sec-xrp-etf-deadline-begins/) to decide on two XRP-based ETFs. These include the Grayscale and 21Shares XRP ETFs, following their filings in the Federal Register in February.

Additionally, [BeInCrypto reported that major asset managers](https://beincrypto.com/xrp-etf-approval-odds-2025-blackrock-fidelity/), including BlackRock and Fidelity, could soon file for an XRP ETF, joining WisdomTree, Bitwise, and Canary Capital.

As regulatory clarity around digital currencies continues to evolve, the market will be watching closely to see how this pioneering ETF performs and whether it paves the way for further XRP-based financial products in the US.
