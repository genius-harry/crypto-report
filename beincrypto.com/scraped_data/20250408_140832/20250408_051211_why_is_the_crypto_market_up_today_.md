**The total crypto market cap (TOTAL) and Bitcoin (BTC) are stabilizing after the massive drawdown observed over the weekend. Among the altcoins, Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) seems to have taken the lead with a 32% rise today.**

In the news today:-

  * [MANTRA is launching](https://beincrypto.com/mantra-rwa-ecosystem-fund-om-price-steady/) a $108.8 million Ecosystem Fund to drive RWA innovation and accelerate blockchain projects. The firm has also secured a VASP license in Dubai, enabling it to offer advanced financial services, including crypto exchange, broker-dealer, and investment management.
  * [Binance Research highlighted](https://beincrypto.com/binance-research-rwa-tokens-low-risk-during-tariffs/) that Trump’s tariffs negatively impacted riskier investments, while RWAs and exchanges were less affected. The report also revealed that Bitcoin's perceived risk rose due to its correlation with stock markets, with only 3% of investors favoring it during a trade war.

## The Crypto Market Is Stable

The total crypto market cap added $48 billion in the last 24 hours, reaching $2.51 trillion. Securing $2.50 trillion as support is crucial for further recovery. A sustained hold above this level could bring renewed optimism among investors and push the market cap toward $2.61 trillion, recovering losses.

Confidence among crypto investors depends on TOTAL reclaiming $2.50 trillion as support. If sustained, this could signal an uptrend, driving the market cap to $2.61 trillion. As the market stabilizes, bullish sentiment might return, attracting more capital and potentially reversing recent declines. This could fuel further upward momentum.

However, if the crypto market fails to hold $2.50 trillion, the total market cap might slip to $2.41 trillion. Such a decline would deepen the losses from recent bearish movements. If investor sentiment weakens, this could prompt further withdrawals and extend the downward trend across crypto assets.

## Bitcoin is Holding Above Key Support

[Bitcoin’s price](https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-etf-derivatives-daily/) is currently holding above the support of $82,503 but is struggling to breach the $85,000 resistance. This short-term target is crucial for BTC to regain upward momentum and potentially reach $90,000.

Should the current stability persist, Bitcoin could bounce back and breach the $85,000 resistance. Successfully surpassing this level would likely propel BTC towards $86,822, a significant barrier that has held for nearly a month. This breakout could spark a rally and further boost investor sentiment.

However, if [Bitcoin loses](https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-fails-to-secure-support/) support at $82,503, the price could dip to $80,000. A break below this psychological support level would indicate further weakness, potentially sending Bitcoin down to $76,741. This decline could increase selling pressure and negatively impact market sentiment.

## Fartcoin Is Noting Gains

FARTCOIN has emerged as the best-performing altcoin of the day, rising by 32% to trade at $0.58. The meme coin is facing resistance at $0.60, which it is attempting to break through. A successful breakout could signal further upside potential for FARTCOIN in the coming days.

If FARTCOIN manages to breach the $0.60 resistance, it could rise to $0.69, marking a two-month high. This would also bring the meme coin closer to the $1.00 mark. Investors are closely watching for confirmation of a sustained upward trend, which would signal a stronger bullish outlook.

However, if FARTCOIN fails to break $0.60, it could fall back to $0.37, reversing recent gains. This would likely lead to a consolidation period or further declines. The meme coin's recovery potential depends on overcoming resistance and maintaining upward momentum.
