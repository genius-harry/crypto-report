Russia has started using crypto for oil trades with China and India as it seeks to bypass Western sanctions, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-leans-cryptocurrencies-oil-trade-sources-say-2025-03-14/) on March 14, citing sources familiar with the matter.

According to the report, some Russian oil companies have settled trades in [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/), [Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/), and stablecoins like Tether’s [USDT](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/). This strategy simplifies the conversion of Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupees into Russian Rubles, enabling smoother transactions despite financial restrictions.

Typically, a Chinese buyer deposits Yuan into an offshore account controlled by an intermediary. The funds are then converted into crypto and transferred through multiple accounts before reaching a final destination in Russia, where they are exchanged for Rubles.

These transactions reportedly reach tens of millions of dollars per month.

Although crypto adoption in Russia’s oil trade remains limited, it is [part of a broader trend](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-firms-turn-to-bitcoin-stablecoins-for-global-trade-amid-sanctions/). Over the past year, the country has [introduced new regulations](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-contemplating-permanently-legalizing-stablecoins-for-cross-border-payments/) governing [crypto mining](https://cryptoslate.com/russias-bitcoin-mining-demand-triples-amid-regulatory-shifts-and-price-rally/), taxation, and international trade.

[Western sanctions imposed over Russia’s](https://cryptoslate.com/tether-freezes-27m-on-garantex-forcing-halt-of-russian-linked-exchange/) military actions in Ukraine have accelerated this shift toward digital assets. However, industry sources suggest oil firms may continue using cryptocurrencies even if sanctions are lifted due to their efficiency and transaction speed.

## Digital rubles challenges

While Russia increases its reliance on crypto for trade, its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project is facing significant hurdles.

Last month, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina [announced](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-delays-digital-ruble-cbdc-launch-extends-pilot-phase-indefinitely/) an indefinite delay in the launch of the digital ruble. She attributed the setback to the need for further refinements to ensure that the currency benefits all stakeholders.

However, a recent survey indicates that the digital ruble launch was postponed due to the inadequate IT infrastructure of banks that were expected to handle the project.

The survey of Russian banking experts revealed that 30% of financial institutions are not yet prepared to support the digital ruble. Experts explained that implementing the CBDC requires banks to upgrade their IT systems to handle increased transaction volumes.

Meanwhile, 20% of banking IT specialists stated that their systems are fully equipped for the digital ruble. Another 50% said they are partially prepared but need further upgrades.

At the same time, around 14% of the respondents expressed concerns over potential information security risks associated with the currency.

Given these challenges, Russia’s national digital asset initiative could face further obstacles unless major financial institutions fully prepare for its adoption.

Mark Yusko discusses Metaplanet Bitcoin buys and BTC’s future

In a recent SlateCast episode, Mark Yusko, CEO and co-founder of Morgan Creek Capital Management, joined host Liam “Akiba” Wright and CryptoSlate Senior Analyst James Van Straten to discuss Bitcoin’s future, market manipulation, and the evolution of money.Yusko shared insights on Bitcoin’s value proposition, the impact of ETFs, and the broader implications of crypto adoption.Bitcoin’s Value and Price PredictionsYusko explained his prediction of Bitcoin reaching $250,000 in the coming years, basing it on the total value of the Bitcoin network. He stated:“If it’s going to replace gold, the value of gold globally is about $12 trillion. Half of that doesn’t really count… The monetary value of gold, the bars that sit in central banks, that’s about $6 trillion.”He further elaborated on the four-year cycle driven by Bitcoin halving events, suggesting that the fair value of Bitcoin doubles with each halving. Yusko predicted that the current cycle could see Bitcoin reach $100,000 as fair value, potentially reaching $1 million in the next cycle.Market Manipulation and Price SuppressionThe discussion touched on market manipulation, with Yusko drawing parallels between Bitcoin and gold markets. He argued that both are subject to price suppression:“The Rothschild Bank in London, which sets the price of gold globally, has been fixing that price through this manipulation of the futures market for years.”Yusko expressed concern about applying similar tactics to Bitcoin, particularly with the introduction of ETFs and the growth of the futures market.The Evolution of Money and Financial SystemsYusko provided a historical perspective on the evolution of information dissemination and financial systems. He argued that Bitcoin and blockchain technology represent the next significant shift:“We’re about to bust the oldest monopoly in the world left, which is financial services. Banking, right? Banking was started back in the 1100s by the Portuguese monks, the Knights Templar, and it has em

Building the decentralized data layer with Powerloom’s Swaroop Hegde

Swaroop Hegde, CEO and Co-Founder of Powerloom, joined CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief, Liam “Akiba” Wright, and CEO Nate Whitehill on The SlateCast to discuss the future of decentralized data layers. Backed by notable names like Blockchain Capital and Filecoin, Powerloom is setting a new standard for composable and decentralized data solutions, reshaping how users interact with on-chain data and fostering innovation across web3 applications.The Challenge of Reliable On-Chain DataSwaroop began by highlighting the current inefficiencies in accessing and verifying on-chain data. Traditional methods rely heavily on centralized sources, such as CoinMarketCap or specific blockchain dashboards, leading to potential data manipulation and outdated information.“Most of the usage when it goes outside of the dApp is actually coming from some sort of centralized indexer,”Swaroop noted, emphasizing the vulnerabilities inherent in such a setup.Powerloom addresses these issues with a decentralized node network, enabling real-time data computation without the need for a centralized intermediary.“With over 5,300 nodes, even non-technical users can contribute to the network, ensuring verifiability and reliability,” he explained.Powerloom’s Unique Approach to Data CompositionUnlike traditional indexers, Powerloom operates on a demand-driven system that aggregates data atomically. Swaroop explained,“We don’t sit and index all the data. Instead, we focus on composing data dynamically based on demand.”This approach allows Powerloom to cater to a variety of use cases, from trading data to lending rates across multiple chains.The platform’s composability extends beyond Uniswap and Aave, creating “data markets” that empower users to craft personalized queries and insights. These markets are decentralized and verifiable, ensuring users can trust the integrity of their data.Introducing Generative Prediction Markets (GPM)A standout feature discussed was Powerloom’s Generative Prediction Markets

From failure to fortune: Jonathan Bouzanquet on blockchain and gaming

Jonathan Bouzanquet, the Co-Founder and Chief Strategy Officer of Playa3ull Games, joined CryptoSlate’s SlateCast alongside Editor-in-Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill. In a thought-provoking discussion, Bouzanquet shared his vision for blockchain gaming, emphasizing a community-first approach, sustainable funding, and the potential of blockchain technology to revolutionize the gaming industry.Building Games Backwards: A Player-Centric PhilosophyThe discussion delved into Playa3ull's unique approach to game development, which they call "building games backwards." This method emphasizes community involvement from the outset.Jonathan stated, "With Play3bull, we bring the community back into the game. We don't want to just tell the player, this is our game, play it or fuck off. We want to say, here's the game. What do you think? How can we make it better?"This strategy involves an advisory council rather than a traditional DAO, aiming for a dialogue between developers and players to shape the game's evolution based on real feedback.The Importance of Digital Asset OwnershipA significant part of the conversation revolved around the benefits of blockchain for gaming, particularly in terms of asset ownership. Jonathan highlighted the frustrations with traditional gaming where players do not own their in-game achievements."Since you invest such enormous amounts of time, it's important to have those assets owned and they are valuable,"he remarked, envisioning a future where these assets could have inter-game utility.Playa3ull's Economic Model: The Bull TokenJonathan detailed Playa3ull's economic system, centered around the Bull Token. Unlike many gaming platforms with separate tokens for each game, Playa3ull uses a single token across its ecosystem for stability and broader utility."So, our coin comes into existence through our node system... half the coin goes to the company for company function, and half the coin goes to the nodes,"he explained, outlining a
