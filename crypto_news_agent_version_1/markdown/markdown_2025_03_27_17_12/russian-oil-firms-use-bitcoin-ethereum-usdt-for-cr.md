Russia has started using crypto for oil trades with China and India as it seeks to bypass Western sanctions, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-leans-cryptocurrencies-oil-trade-sources-say-2025-03-14/) on March 14, citing sources familiar with the matter.

According to the report, some Russian oil companies have settled trades in [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/), [Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/), and stablecoins like Tether’s [USDT](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/). This strategy simplifies the conversion of Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupees into Russian Rubles, enabling smoother transactions despite financial restrictions.

Typically, a Chinese buyer deposits Yuan into an offshore account controlled by an intermediary. The funds are then converted into crypto and transferred through multiple accounts before reaching a final destination in Russia, where they are exchanged for Rubles.

These transactions reportedly reach tens of millions of dollars per month.

Although crypto adoption in Russia’s oil trade remains limited, it is [part of a broader trend](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-firms-turn-to-bitcoin-stablecoins-for-global-trade-amid-sanctions/). Over the past year, the country has [introduced new regulations](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-contemplating-permanently-legalizing-stablecoins-for-cross-border-payments/) governing [crypto mining](https://cryptoslate.com/russias-bitcoin-mining-demand-triples-amid-regulatory-shifts-and-price-rally/), taxation, and international trade.

[Western sanctions imposed over Russia’s](https://cryptoslate.com/tether-freezes-27m-on-garantex-forcing-halt-of-russian-linked-exchange/) military actions in Ukraine have accelerated this shift toward digital assets. However, industry sources suggest oil firms may continue using cryptocurrencies even if sanctions are lifted due to their efficiency and transaction speed.

## Digital rubles challenges

While Russia increases its reliance on crypto for trade, its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project is facing significant hurdles.

Last month, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina [announced](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-delays-digital-ruble-cbdc-launch-extends-pilot-phase-indefinitely/) an indefinite delay in the launch of the digital ruble. She attributed the setback to the need for further refinements to ensure that the currency benefits all stakeholders.

However, a recent survey indicates that the digital ruble launch was postponed due to the inadequate IT infrastructure of banks that were expected to handle the project.

The survey of Russian banking experts revealed that 30% of financial institutions are not yet prepared to support the digital ruble. Experts explained that implementing the CBDC requires banks to upgrade their IT systems to handle increased transaction volumes.

Meanwhile, 20% of banking IT specialists stated that their systems are fully equipped for the digital ruble. Another 50% said they are partially prepared but need further upgrades.

At the same time, around 14% of the respondents expressed concerns over potential information security risks associated with the currency.

Given these challenges, Russia’s national digital asset initiative could face further obstacles unless major financial institutions fully prepare for its adoption.

Exploring decentralized AI and artistic innovation with Dimitri de Jong of 204.ai

The latest SlateCast episode featured Dimitri de Jong, founder and CTO of 204.ai, in conversation with Liam “Akiba” Wright, Editor in Chief of CryptoSlate, and Nate Whitehill, CEO of CryptoSlate. The discussion centered on de Jong’s innovative work at the intersection of AI, blockchain, and artistic expression. His experience spans decades of research and development in decentralized systems, blending technology with creative vision.From Microelectronics to AI and BlockchainDimitri’s journey began with a foundation in microelectronics and systems theory. As he explained, this background provided a deep understanding of complex systems and their optimization. His work in the 2010s revolved around using machine learning to simulate rare events and improve microchip designs for diverse environments, from space missions to nuclear reactors.“I specialized in systems theory and nonlinear systems to optimize designs in virtual environments,” said Dimitri. “That foundation translates directly into understanding decentralized systems.”This knowledge eventually led him to blockchain and AI, where he developed data sovereignty solutions such as Ocean Protocol, a decentralized data exchange, and Nevermind, focused on AI agents and data ownership.204.ai: Fusing Art and TechnologyDimitri described 204.ai as an “interactive design studio” where AI and artistic research converge. The studio explores immersive generative art, creating unique experiences like stepping into AI-enhanced paintings or witnessing fossils “come alive” through dynamic overlays.“We aim to make AI interactions multi-sensory and deeply engaging,” he said. “For example, we use brain-computer interfaces to enhance real-time generative designs.”204.ai’s work spans institutional projects and public-facing immersive experiences. From kinetic installations to AI-driven nature simulations, Dimitri emphasized the importance of bridging creative expression and technological advancement.The Vision of a Universal Recomme

How Layer3 is reshaping on-chain user value - Brandon Kumar explains

CryptoSlate’s SlateCast recently welcomed Brandon Kumar, co-founder of Layer3, to discuss the platform’s mission to revolutionize crypto engagement through user-owned value. Joined by CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill, Kumar shared insights into Layer3’s business model, future goals, and the broader trends shaping the crypto industry.Redefining User-Owned ValueLayer3’s core mission centers on "user-owned value," a concept that flips the traditional advertising model on its head. Kumar explained, “When a user is spending time on Layer3, they're actually able to earn, in addition to discovering and finding protocols relevant to their needs and interests.” Unlike traditional platforms like Google or Facebook, which monetize user attention for corporate profit, Layer3 ensures users share the economic value generated from their activity.By fostering this shift, Layer3 provides users a more direct connection to protocols and projects within the crypto ecosystem. Kumar elaborated,“What we're trying to basically convey is this notion of a user who spends time but also earns economic value while being advertised to.”The Journey from Traditional Finance to CryptoKumar’s background in traditional finance significantly shaped his approach to Layer3. He previously worked at Accolade Partners, a prominent alternative asset manager, where he gained experience in venture capital and technology investments.“We looked at what was happening in crypto venture and said it resembles a lot of what was happening in the 80s and 90s within traditional venture capital,” Kumar noted.This unique perspective allowed Kumar to recognize the potential of the crypto space early on. He emphasized that his financial experience taught him the importance of robust business models and defensibility. “Understanding business models and thinking about them in a dispassionate way was essential,” he said, adding that the experience helped him make strategic choices in La

Paul Kohlhaas explores crypto’s role in revolutionizing Biotech

In a recent episode of the SlateCast, Paul Kohlhaas, the founder of BIO Protocol, joined CryptoSlate CEO Nate Whitehill and Senior Editor Liam "Akiba" Wright to discuss the future of biotechnology through decentralized science (DeSci). Kohlhaas explained BIO Protocol's vision for revolutionizing biotech funding and research by utilizing decentralized, open-source methods.Biotechnology as the Substrate for LifeBIO XYZ represents more than a typical biotech initiative. As Kohlhaas explained,“BIO XYZ stands for a movement to not be afraid of biotechnology, to like embrace it, and that it should be much more open source, back in the hands of the people.”The concept draws from "bio-accelerationism," echoing the AI acceleration movement in the tech world. Biotechnology, Kohlhaas argues, should be considered a new "substrate for life," akin to how artificial intelligence became a new substrate for intelligence.Kohlhaas elaborated on the fear surrounding biotechnology and genetic engineering, drawing parallels with the early fears surrounding AI.“People are afraid of genetic engineering and new biotechnological advances. However, just as AI has seen a movement to decentralize it, we believe biotechnology should be back in the hands of the people.”Empowering Patients and Scientists with DAOsBIO Protocol’s core innovation is decentralizing biotech research by connecting scientists, patients, and investors through decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). These DAOs allow communities to directly fund research that addresses specific medical challenges. Kohlhaas highlighted VitaDAO as a successful example, stating,“VitaDAO funded research into autophagy activators—substances that help healthy cells eliminate old cells—leading to novel drug developments.”In this decentralized model, patients can have a more significant role, providing not only funds but also valuable insights. “Patients often know what’s best for them,” Kohlhaas remarked, emphasizing the importance of invol
