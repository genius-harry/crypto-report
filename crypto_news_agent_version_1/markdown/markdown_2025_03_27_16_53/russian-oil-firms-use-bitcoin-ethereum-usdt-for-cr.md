Russia has started using crypto for oil trades with China and India as it seeks to bypass Western sanctions, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-leans-cryptocurrencies-oil-trade-sources-say-2025-03-14/) on March 14, citing sources familiar with the matter.

According to the report, some Russian oil companies have settled trades in [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/), [Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/), and stablecoins like Tether’s [USDT](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/). This strategy simplifies the conversion of Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupees into Russian Rubles, enabling smoother transactions despite financial restrictions.

Typically, a Chinese buyer deposits Yuan into an offshore account controlled by an intermediary. The funds are then converted into crypto and transferred through multiple accounts before reaching a final destination in Russia, where they are exchanged for Rubles.

These transactions reportedly reach tens of millions of dollars per month.

Although crypto adoption in Russia’s oil trade remains limited, it is [part of a broader trend](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-firms-turn-to-bitcoin-stablecoins-for-global-trade-amid-sanctions/). Over the past year, the country has [introduced new regulations](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-contemplating-permanently-legalizing-stablecoins-for-cross-border-payments/) governing [crypto mining](https://cryptoslate.com/russias-bitcoin-mining-demand-triples-amid-regulatory-shifts-and-price-rally/), taxation, and international trade.

[Western sanctions imposed over Russia’s](https://cryptoslate.com/tether-freezes-27m-on-garantex-forcing-halt-of-russian-linked-exchange/) military actions in Ukraine have accelerated this shift toward digital assets. However, industry sources suggest oil firms may continue using cryptocurrencies even if sanctions are lifted due to their efficiency and transaction speed.

## Digital rubles challenges

While Russia increases its reliance on crypto for trade, its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project is facing significant hurdles.

Last month, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina [announced](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-delays-digital-ruble-cbdc-launch-extends-pilot-phase-indefinitely/) an indefinite delay in the launch of the digital ruble. She attributed the setback to the need for further refinements to ensure that the currency benefits all stakeholders.

However, a recent survey indicates that the digital ruble launch was postponed due to the inadequate IT infrastructure of banks that were expected to handle the project.

The survey of Russian banking experts revealed that 30% of financial institutions are not yet prepared to support the digital ruble. Experts explained that implementing the CBDC requires banks to upgrade their IT systems to handle increased transaction volumes.

Meanwhile, 20% of banking IT specialists stated that their systems are fully equipped for the digital ruble. Another 50% said they are partially prepared but need further upgrades.

At the same time, around 14% of the respondents expressed concerns over potential information security risks associated with the currency.

Given these challenges, Russia’s national digital asset initiative could face further obstacles unless major financial institutions fully prepare for its adoption.

Sunny Aggarwal details how Polaris unlocks effortless multi-chain trading Experiences

In a recent episode of the SlateCast, Sunny Aggarwal, Co-founder of Osmosis Labs and Polaris, joined CryptoSlate’s Editor in Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright to discuss the future of cross-chain decentralized finance (DeFi), the rise of multi-chain ecosystems, and his new venture, Polaris. Aggarwal delved into the innovations within Cosmos, the role of Bitcoin in decentralized finance, and Polaris’s goal to unify trading across various blockchain networks.Bitcoin’s Growing Integration with DeFiAggarwal started by discussing the evolving role of Bitcoin within the Cosmos ecosystem. He emphasized that the decentralized finance landscape is increasingly incorporating Bitcoin, which he sees as essential for a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem. “Bitcoin DeFi is continuing to grow and happen,” he said, referring to the expansion of DeFi layers, such as ThorChain, that bring Bitcoin into decentralized applications.Osmosis, Aggarwal’s previous project, has integrated various Bitcoin bridges, including Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), NOMIC, and CKBTC. These integrations provide additional trading options for users and help expand Bitcoin’s use case in Cosmos. “Alloyed Bitcoin is live on Osmosis and is one of our most traded assets,” Aggarwal noted, highlighting how these new offerings have significantly increased activity within the platform.Polaris: A Unified Platform for Multi-Chain TradingAggarwal’s latest venture, Polaris, aims to tackle one of DeFi’s greatest challenges: fragmented liquidity across chains. Centralized exchanges allow users to trade across multiple assets, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, on one platform, while decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have traditionally been limited by chain-specific liquidity pools. Polaris seeks to overcome this limitation by creating a platform that aggregates liquidity across ecosystems, allowing users to execute cross-chain trades seamlessly.“On centralized exchanges, you can trade Bitcoin, ETH, and SOL all in one spot, but on DEXs, you ne

Exploring decentralized AI and artistic innovation with Dimitri de Jong of 204.ai

The latest SlateCast episode featured Dimitri de Jong, founder and CTO of 204.ai, in conversation with Liam “Akiba” Wright, Editor in Chief of CryptoSlate, and Nate Whitehill, CEO of CryptoSlate. The discussion centered on de Jong’s innovative work at the intersection of AI, blockchain, and artistic expression. His experience spans decades of research and development in decentralized systems, blending technology with creative vision.From Microelectronics to AI and BlockchainDimitri’s journey began with a foundation in microelectronics and systems theory. As he explained, this background provided a deep understanding of complex systems and their optimization. His work in the 2010s revolved around using machine learning to simulate rare events and improve microchip designs for diverse environments, from space missions to nuclear reactors.“I specialized in systems theory and nonlinear systems to optimize designs in virtual environments,” said Dimitri. “That foundation translates directly into understanding decentralized systems.”This knowledge eventually led him to blockchain and AI, where he developed data sovereignty solutions such as Ocean Protocol, a decentralized data exchange, and Nevermind, focused on AI agents and data ownership.204.ai: Fusing Art and TechnologyDimitri described 204.ai as an “interactive design studio” where AI and artistic research converge. The studio explores immersive generative art, creating unique experiences like stepping into AI-enhanced paintings or witnessing fossils “come alive” through dynamic overlays.“We aim to make AI interactions multi-sensory and deeply engaging,” he said. “For example, we use brain-computer interfaces to enhance real-time generative designs.”204.ai’s work spans institutional projects and public-facing immersive experiences. From kinetic installations to AI-driven nature simulations, Dimitri emphasized the importance of bridging creative expression and technological advancement.The Vision of a Universal Recomme

Robin Obermaier discusses Bitcoin DeFi and cross-chain lending

In a recent episode of SlateCast, CryptoSlate's Senior Editor Liam "Akiba" Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill sat down with Robin Obermaier, the CEO and founder of Liquidium, to discuss the evolving landscape of DeFi on Bitcoin and the future of cross-chain lending.The Rise of Bitcoin DeFiObermaier began by addressing the current state of DeFi on Bitcoin, acknowledging its infancy while highlighting the progress made in fundamental technologies. He stated:"DeFi on Bitcoin is still in its infancy. Despite obviously a lot of people saying like, Bitcoin will have all of the tools that Ethereum has and Solana has within like a couple of months. That's just not realistic because we have so many more challenges on Bitcoin that we still have to overcome."Liquidium's Peer-to-Peer Lending ProtocolThe conversation then shifted to Liquidium's core offering - a peer-to-peer lending protocol for Bitcoin-based assets. Obermaier demonstrated the platform's functionality, explaining how lenders can create loan offers against Ordinals, Runes, and BRC20 tokens, while borrowers can use these assets as collateral to obtain Bitcoin loans."Lenders are creating offers, borrowers are accepting offers, lenders are countersigning, and then the loan starts," Obermaier explained, highlighting the simplicity of the process.Expanding to Eastern MarketsWhen asked about Liquidium's plans to adapt to Eastern markets, which are heavily focused on fungible tokens, Obermaier outlined their strategy:"We started a basically a Chinese Twitter account. We translated our landing page to Chinese already and then also going to translate the application soon. We're also seeing a large influx from the Brazilian market, actually."Bitcoin Layer 2s and Cross-Chain SolutionsThe discussion then turned to the potential of building on Bitcoin Layer 2s. Obermaier expressed a preference for solutions that allow interaction with Layer 1 Bitcoin, citing concerns about fragmentation and the need for users to bridge or wrap ass
