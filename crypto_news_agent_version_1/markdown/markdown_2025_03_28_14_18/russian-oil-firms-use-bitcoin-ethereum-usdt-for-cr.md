Russia has started using crypto for oil trades with China and India as it seeks to bypass Western sanctions, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-leans-cryptocurrencies-oil-trade-sources-say-2025-03-14/) on March 14, citing sources familiar with the matter.

According to the report, some Russian oil companies have settled trades in [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/), [Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/), and stablecoins like Tether’s [USDT](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/). This strategy simplifies the conversion of Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupees into Russian Rubles, enabling smoother transactions despite financial restrictions.

Typically, a Chinese buyer deposits Yuan into an offshore account controlled by an intermediary. The funds are then converted into crypto and transferred through multiple accounts before reaching a final destination in Russia, where they are exchanged for Rubles.

These transactions reportedly reach tens of millions of dollars per month.

Although crypto adoption in Russia’s oil trade remains limited, it is [part of a broader trend](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-firms-turn-to-bitcoin-stablecoins-for-global-trade-amid-sanctions/). Over the past year, the country has [introduced new regulations](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-contemplating-permanently-legalizing-stablecoins-for-cross-border-payments/) governing [crypto mining](https://cryptoslate.com/russias-bitcoin-mining-demand-triples-amid-regulatory-shifts-and-price-rally/), taxation, and international trade.

[Western sanctions imposed over Russia’s](https://cryptoslate.com/tether-freezes-27m-on-garantex-forcing-halt-of-russian-linked-exchange/) military actions in Ukraine have accelerated this shift toward digital assets. However, industry sources suggest oil firms may continue using cryptocurrencies even if sanctions are lifted due to their efficiency and transaction speed.

## Digital rubles challenges

While Russia increases its reliance on crypto for trade, its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project is facing significant hurdles.

Last month, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina [announced](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-delays-digital-ruble-cbdc-launch-extends-pilot-phase-indefinitely/) an indefinite delay in the launch of the digital ruble. She attributed the setback to the need for further refinements to ensure that the currency benefits all stakeholders.

However, a recent survey indicates that the digital ruble launch was postponed due to the inadequate IT infrastructure of banks that were expected to handle the project.

The survey of Russian banking experts revealed that 30% of financial institutions are not yet prepared to support the digital ruble. Experts explained that implementing the CBDC requires banks to upgrade their IT systems to handle increased transaction volumes.

Meanwhile, 20% of banking IT specialists stated that their systems are fully equipped for the digital ruble. Another 50% said they are partially prepared but need further upgrades.

At the same time, around 14% of the respondents expressed concerns over potential information security risks associated with the currency.

Given these challenges, Russia’s national digital asset initiative could face further obstacles unless major financial institutions fully prepare for its adoption.

Phillip Alexeev on CrossFi: The bridge between crypto and traditional banking

In a recent episode of SlateCast, Phillip Alexeev, Chief Growth Officer at CrossFi, joined CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill to discuss the platform's innovative solutions to integrate crypto with traditional finance. CrossFi’s mission is to provide seamless financial inclusivity through a robust ecosystem that supports non-custodial crypto transactions, partnerships with banks, and scalable blockchain technology.Alexeev described CrossFi as “the Apple Pay for crypto,” emphasizing its role as a bridge between decentralized finance (DeFi) and mainstream banking.“Our focus has always been empowering users by removing gatekeepers while providing access to advanced financial tools,” he said.Non-Custodial Payments RedefinedAt its core, CrossFi offers a unique payment technology enabling users to transact directly from their Web3 wallets at any point-of-sale terminal worldwide. This approach eliminates the need for custodial platforms, maintaining users’ control over their funds. Alexeev highlighted the platform's ability to “connect any Web3 wallet to the CrossFi app,” facilitating crypto-to-fiat transactions seamlessly and securely.Unlike traditional crypto cards, CrossFi partners directly with banks to interact with smart contracts, bypassing third-party intermediaries.“We’ve designed an ecosystem with fewer points of failure while forcing banks to innovate and adopt crypto technology,” Alexeev explained.Why Build a New Layer-1 Blockchain?Addressing the decision to build a proprietary layer-1 blockchain, Alexeev acknowledged the challenges of integrating blockchain with existing banking infrastructure.“No existing blockchain met the security, scalability, and compatibility requirements of traditional banks,” he stated.The customized blockchain allows CrossFi to support seamless interaction between decentralized technologies and institutional frameworks.Flat Fees for TransparencyCrossFi aims to disrupt conventional payment systems

Building the decentralized data layer with Powerloom’s Swaroop Hegde

Swaroop Hegde, CEO and Co-Founder of Powerloom, joined CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief, Liam “Akiba” Wright, and CEO Nate Whitehill on The SlateCast to discuss the future of decentralized data layers. Backed by notable names like Blockchain Capital and Filecoin, Powerloom is setting a new standard for composable and decentralized data solutions, reshaping how users interact with on-chain data and fostering innovation across web3 applications.The Challenge of Reliable On-Chain DataSwaroop began by highlighting the current inefficiencies in accessing and verifying on-chain data. Traditional methods rely heavily on centralized sources, such as CoinMarketCap or specific blockchain dashboards, leading to potential data manipulation and outdated information.“Most of the usage when it goes outside of the dApp is actually coming from some sort of centralized indexer,”Swaroop noted, emphasizing the vulnerabilities inherent in such a setup.Powerloom addresses these issues with a decentralized node network, enabling real-time data computation without the need for a centralized intermediary.“With over 5,300 nodes, even non-technical users can contribute to the network, ensuring verifiability and reliability,” he explained.Powerloom’s Unique Approach to Data CompositionUnlike traditional indexers, Powerloom operates on a demand-driven system that aggregates data atomically. Swaroop explained,“We don’t sit and index all the data. Instead, we focus on composing data dynamically based on demand.”This approach allows Powerloom to cater to a variety of use cases, from trading data to lending rates across multiple chains.The platform’s composability extends beyond Uniswap and Aave, creating “data markets” that empower users to craft personalized queries and insights. These markets are decentralized and verifiable, ensuring users can trust the integrity of their data.Introducing Generative Prediction Markets (GPM)A standout feature discussed was Powerloom’s Generative Prediction Markets
