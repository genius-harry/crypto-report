Oil companies in Russia are using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies including ethereum and the stablecoin tether to help convert rubles to China’s yuan and India’s rupee, it was [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-leans-cryptocurrencies-oil-trade-sources-say-2025-03-14/) by _Reuters_, citing anonymous sources.\
\
Bitcoin and crypto are now favored as a means of trade among Russia’s oil companies to the extent they would continue to be used even if sanctions were lifted and the U.S. dollar could be used again, according to the report.\
\
Russian oligarchs and billionaires hit by severe financial restrictions following the country’s invasion of Ukraine [reportedly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/03/03/sactioned-russian-oligarchs-and-billionaires-have-only-one-option-bitcoin/) turned to bitcoin and crypto as far back as 2022.\
\
Meanwhile, the Bank of Russia has [announced](https://www.cbr.ru/press/event/?id=23448) this week it intends to allow a “limited circle of Russian investors” to buy and sell bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\
\
“In accordance with the instructions of the president of Russia, the Bank of Russia has sent proposals to the government for discussion on regulating investments in cryptocurrencies,” a translated announcement read.\
\
"This is a new status that ... citizens will receive if their investments in securities and deposits exceed 100 million rubles or if their income over the past year was more than 50 million rubles.”\

\
Russia’s central bank has gradually softened its opposition to bitcoin and crypto, last year backing a law that allowed businesses to use crypto for international trade.\
\
Russia’s growing support for bitcoin and crypto comes as Donald Trump’s administration gears up to make bitcoin a strategic reserve asset, freezing the planned sale of bitcoin and crypto the U.S. has seized.\
\
This week, a White House leak has revealed one of Donald Trump’s top bitcoin and crypto officials reportedly said the Trump administration wants to acquire as much bitcoin as possible—helping the reverse a bitcoin price sell-off that was triggered by Trump’s bitcoin reserve plans falling short of expectations.\
\
In December, [a leak revealed Russia lawmakers were pushing for the country to create a bitcoin strategic reserve similar to that proposed by Trump](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/12/10/leak-reveals-russias-bid-for-bitcoin-reserve-amid-huge-2025-price-predictions/).\
