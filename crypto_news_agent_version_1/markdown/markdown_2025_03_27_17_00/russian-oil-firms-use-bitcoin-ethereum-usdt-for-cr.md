Russia has started using crypto for oil trades with China and India as it seeks to bypass Western sanctions, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-leans-cryptocurrencies-oil-trade-sources-say-2025-03-14/) on March 14, citing sources familiar with the matter.

According to the report, some Russian oil companies have settled trades in [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/), [Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/), and stablecoins like Tether’s [USDT](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/). This strategy simplifies the conversion of Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupees into Russian Rubles, enabling smoother transactions despite financial restrictions.

Typically, a Chinese buyer deposits Yuan into an offshore account controlled by an intermediary. The funds are then converted into crypto and transferred through multiple accounts before reaching a final destination in Russia, where they are exchanged for Rubles.

These transactions reportedly reach tens of millions of dollars per month.

Although crypto adoption in Russia’s oil trade remains limited, it is [part of a broader trend](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-firms-turn-to-bitcoin-stablecoins-for-global-trade-amid-sanctions/). Over the past year, the country has [introduced new regulations](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-contemplating-permanently-legalizing-stablecoins-for-cross-border-payments/) governing [crypto mining](https://cryptoslate.com/russias-bitcoin-mining-demand-triples-amid-regulatory-shifts-and-price-rally/), taxation, and international trade.

[Western sanctions imposed over Russia’s](https://cryptoslate.com/tether-freezes-27m-on-garantex-forcing-halt-of-russian-linked-exchange/) military actions in Ukraine have accelerated this shift toward digital assets. However, industry sources suggest oil firms may continue using cryptocurrencies even if sanctions are lifted due to their efficiency and transaction speed.

## Digital rubles challenges

While Russia increases its reliance on crypto for trade, its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project is facing significant hurdles.

Last month, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina [announced](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-delays-digital-ruble-cbdc-launch-extends-pilot-phase-indefinitely/) an indefinite delay in the launch of the digital ruble. She attributed the setback to the need for further refinements to ensure that the currency benefits all stakeholders.

However, a recent survey indicates that the digital ruble launch was postponed due to the inadequate IT infrastructure of banks that were expected to handle the project.

The survey of Russian banking experts revealed that 30% of financial institutions are not yet prepared to support the digital ruble. Experts explained that implementing the CBDC requires banks to upgrade their IT systems to handle increased transaction volumes.

Meanwhile, 20% of banking IT specialists stated that their systems are fully equipped for the digital ruble. Another 50% said they are partially prepared but need further upgrades.

At the same time, around 14% of the respondents expressed concerns over potential information security risks associated with the currency.

Given these challenges, Russia’s national digital asset initiative could face further obstacles unless major financial institutions fully prepare for its adoption.

Robin Obermaier discusses Bitcoin DeFi and cross-chain lending

In a recent episode of SlateCast, CryptoSlate's Senior Editor Liam "Akiba" Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill sat down with Robin Obermaier, the CEO and founder of Liquidium, to discuss the evolving landscape of DeFi on Bitcoin and the future of cross-chain lending.The Rise of Bitcoin DeFiObermaier began by addressing the current state of DeFi on Bitcoin, acknowledging its infancy while highlighting the progress made in fundamental technologies. He stated:"DeFi on Bitcoin is still in its infancy. Despite obviously a lot of people saying like, Bitcoin will have all of the tools that Ethereum has and Solana has within like a couple of months. That's just not realistic because we have so many more challenges on Bitcoin that we still have to overcome."Liquidium's Peer-to-Peer Lending ProtocolThe conversation then shifted to Liquidium's core offering - a peer-to-peer lending protocol for Bitcoin-based assets. Obermaier demonstrated the platform's functionality, explaining how lenders can create loan offers against Ordinals, Runes, and BRC20 tokens, while borrowers can use these assets as collateral to obtain Bitcoin loans."Lenders are creating offers, borrowers are accepting offers, lenders are countersigning, and then the loan starts," Obermaier explained, highlighting the simplicity of the process.Expanding to Eastern MarketsWhen asked about Liquidium's plans to adapt to Eastern markets, which are heavily focused on fungible tokens, Obermaier outlined their strategy:"We started a basically a Chinese Twitter account. We translated our landing page to Chinese already and then also going to translate the application soon. We're also seeing a large influx from the Brazilian market, actually."Bitcoin Layer 2s and Cross-Chain SolutionsThe discussion then turned to the potential of building on Bitcoin Layer 2s. Obermaier expressed a preference for solutions that allow interaction with Layer 1 Bitcoin, citing concerns about fragmentation and the need for users to bridge or wrap ass
