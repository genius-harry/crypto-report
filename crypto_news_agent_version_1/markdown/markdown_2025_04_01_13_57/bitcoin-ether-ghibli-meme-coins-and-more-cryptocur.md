There’s no avoiding the shockwaves from tariffs news this week — not even if you’re an investor in alt currencies that were [supposed to be insulated](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/03/30/heres-how-tariff-uncertainty-could-affect-these-3/) from this sort of thing. Plus, meme coin creators are trying to earn a buck off that weird [Studio Ghibli](https://gizmodo.com/open-ai-ghibli-trend-miyazaki-chatgpt-2000581679?_gl=1*j82g9r*_ga*MzUxNzY2NjAwLjE3MjAwMTcyMjA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzM5NzkwNi4yNTMuMS4xNzQzMzk5MTE0LjYwLjAuMA..)-style AI art trend. And what’s the deal with Ether, the Bitcoin rival that has shed about 43% of its value so far this year?

Is the biggest cryptocurrency a _sure thing_ in 2025? Is anything? Turns out, there’s little to feel certain about in the new [era of mass layoffs](https://qz.com/trump-trade-war-doge-cuts-layoffs-covid-recession-1851768022?_gl=1*x08ygv*_ga*MzUxNzY2NjAwLjE3MjAwMTcyMjA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzM5NzkwNi4yNTMuMS4xNzQzNDAwMDQ0LjUzLjAuMA..), on-again, off-again tariffs, and [stagflation](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/30/stagflation-economy-inflation-growth) fears.

Market uncertainty is one of the things that’s [come to define](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-word-from-u-s-companies-to-wall-street-in-new-trump-era-is-uncertainty-f3b1a20a) the early days of the second Trump administration, and investors in cryptocurrencies and stocks alike will be looking for some clarity on [April 2](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/30/stock-market-today-live-updates.html), when the president is expected to say more about tariffs.

Bitcoin and stock market performance sometimes correlate, but [what happens next is really anyone’s guess](https://qz.com/goldman-sachs-recession-odds-forecast-trump-tariffs-1851773363?_gl=1*13j1ns2*_ga*MzUxNzY2NjAwLjE3MjAwMTcyMjA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzM4OTk5OS4yNTIuMS4xNzQzMzkxNjU5LjYwLjAuMA..). What’s clear is that the back-and-forth on tariffs has soured the crypto market so far this year.

Washington is [still chattering](https://qz.com/tether-bitcoin-fartcoin-cryptocurrencies-to-watch-1851771823/slides/2) about stablecoins, as Congress works toward passing industry-backed stablecoin rules and Democrats react to the [Trump family’s plan to release a stablecoin](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/30/the-trump-family-is-cashing-in-on-crypto-its-creating-problems-in-congress-00255718) pegged to the U.S. dollar.

While the term implies stability, stablecoins can and do become unstable when they’re [unpegged](https://sherwood.news/snacks/a-stablecoin-just-unpegged-from-the-dollar/) from their target asset or currency. In February, Consumer Reports and other groups [asked lawmakers to vote against the brewing House and Senate stablecoin bills](https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Coalition-Letter-Opposing-GENIUS-STABLE-Acts.pdf), saying they “represent a crypto industry wish list, not an adequate regulatory regime that provides necessary oversight, customer protection, and stability.”

As its rival Solana grows, [Ethereum is reportedly shedding developers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-29/crypto-s-trumpian-embrace-is-leaving-bitcoin-s-big-rival-behind?embedded-checkout=true), and its token Ether is lagging behind Bitcoin.

Since Jan. 1, Ether has cratered about 43% while Bitcoin has slipped about 10%. Ripple’s XRP, meanwhile, may appear to be somewhere else entirely — up 3.62% on the year, but it’s [still vulnerable](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/28/dogecoin-xrp-sink-7-as-tariffs-concerns-dent-markets-bitcoin-options-expiry-looms) to chaos.

The fleeting boom of AI-generated, Studio Ghibli-style images on social media has triggered interest in [meme coins inspired by the beloved animation studio](https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/ghibli-style-ai-image-trend-triggers-40000percent-surge-in-solana-meme-coins).

No matter your feelings about Ghibli or Hayao Miyazaki’s [past comments on AI](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/miyazaki-chatgpt-ai-slop-1235305906/), meme coins in general remain [extremely volatile](https://www.investopedia.com/top-risks-of-buying-meme-coins-8782157), and the [SEC](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/staff-statement-meme-coins) stated in February that it sees meme coins as “akin to collectibles” that “typically have limited or no use or functionality.”
