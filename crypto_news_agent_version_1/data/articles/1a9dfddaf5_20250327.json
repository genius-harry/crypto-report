While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational [differences that investors should know](https://www.etftrends.com/crypto-channel/bitcoin-ether-differences-etf-investors-should-know/). We've also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency), a cryptocurrency is \"a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.\"\n\n_For a better understanding of crypto market cycles, read more [here](https://www.etftrends.com/crypto-channel/understanding-crypto-market-cycles/)._\n\n## **Bitcoin**\n\nBitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide to a mainstream financial asset. It is often considered volatile, as seen in our first chart, but one can argue that it is also [resilient](https://www.etftrends.com/crypto-channel/understanding-bitcoins-resilience/). Learn more about [some bitcoin basics for new investors](https://www.etftrends.com/crypto-channel/some-bitcoin-basics-new-investors/).\n\nBitcoin's closing price inched above $87,000 for the first time in nearly three weeks. BTC is down ~7% year to date and ~18% below its record high.\n\n[![Bitcoin daily price since 2017](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content_image/data/35/35fd8b8145fcd5c5c797661d039fa48f.png)](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content_image/data/35/35fd8b8145fcd5c5c797661d039fa48f.png)\n\n[![Bitcoin daily price this year](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content_image/data/d4/d40e4f2cc94ddbfa5aae208b2564f8fa.png)](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content_image/data/d4/d40e4f2cc94ddbfa5aae208b2564f8fa.png)\n\n## **Ether**\n\n[Ether](https://ethereum.org/en/learn/) is a cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and was launched in July 2015. It has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article.\n\nEther's closing price made its way back above $2,000 this week. ETH is now down ~38% year to date and ~57% below its all-time closing high.\n\n[![Ether daily price since 2017](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content_image/data/5a/5aaa3de92145bc25b3164c8ddc1b34d9.png)](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content_image/data/5a/5aaa3de92145bc25b3164c8ddc1b34d9.png)\n\n## **XRP**\n\nXRP, which is owned by [Ripple](https://ripple.com/xrp/), was launched in 2012 and was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market.\n\nXRP surged during the last few months of 2024 and the during the first month of 2025, however, it has pulled back in February and March. XRP is up ~6% year to date.\n\n[![XRP daily price since 2017](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content_image/data/64/640d97b277b5894f7ac33cc3e11e489c.png)](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content_image/data/64/640d97b277b5894f7ac33cc3e11e489c.png)\n\nSign me up to receive email newsletters from **VettaFi Advisor Perspectives**\n\nEmail\\*\n\n## **Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP**\n\nAn index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. The chart tells us which cryptocurrency's price has changed the most since November 9, 2017. At one point or another, all three have been at the top. At the time of writing, bitcoin is in the lead.\n\n[![Bitcoin, Ether, and XRP indexed ](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content_image/data/41/41b47c3964aba3ad51d950481654ea7d.png)](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content_image/data/41/41b47c3964aba3ad51d950481654ea7d.png)\n\n* * *\n\nOn January 10th, 2024, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as [Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC)](https://etfdb.com/etf/GBTC/#etf-ticker-profile), [iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT)](https://etfdb.com/etf/IBIT/#etf-ticker-profile), [Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC)](https://etfdb.com/etf/FBTC/#etf-ticker-profile), [ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB)](https://etfdb.com/etf/ARKB/#etf-ticker-profile), [Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB),](https://etfdb.com/etf/BITB/#etf-ticker-profile) [Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR)](https://etfdb.com/etf/BRRR/#etf-ticker-profile).

While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational [differences that investors should know](https://www.etftrends.com/crypto-channel/bitcoin-ether-differences-etf-investors-should-know/). We've also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency), a cryptocurrency is \"a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.\"\n\n_For a better understanding of crypto market cycles, read more [here](https://www.etftrends.com/crypto-channel/understanding-crypto-market-cycles/)._\n\n## **Bitcoin**\n\nBitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide to a mainstream financial asset. It is often considered volatile, as seen in our first chart, but one can argue that it is also [resilient](https://www.etftrends.com/crypto-channel/understanding-bitcoins-resilience/). Learn more about [some bitcoin basics for new investors](https://www.etftrends.com/crypto-channel/some-bitcoin-basics-new-investors/).\n\nBitcoin's closing price inched above $87,000 for the first time in nearly three weeks. BTC is down ~7% year to date and ~18% below its record high.\n\n[![Bitcoin daily price since 2017](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content_image/data/35/35fd8b8145fcd5c5c797661d039fa48f.png)](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content_image/data/35/35fd8b8145fcd5c5c797661d039fa48f.png)\n\n[![Bitcoin daily price this year](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content_image/data/d4/d40e4f2cc94ddbfa5aae208b2564f8fa.png)](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content_image/data/d4/d40e4f2cc94ddbfa5aae208b2564f8fa.png)\n\n## **Ether**\n\n[Ether](https://ethereum.org/en/learn/) is a cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and was launched in July 2015. It has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article.\n\nEther's closing price made its way back above $2,000 this week. ETH is now down ~38% year to date and ~57% below its all-time closing high.\n\n[![Ether daily price since 2017](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content_image/data/5a/5aaa3de92145bc25b3164c8ddc1b34d9.png)](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content_image/data/5a/5aaa3de92145bc25b3164c8ddc1b34d9.png)\n\n## **XRP**\n\nXRP, which is owned by [Ripple](https://ripple.com/xrp/), was launched in 2012 and was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market.\n\nXRP surged during the last few months of 2024 and the during the first month of 2025, however, it has pulled back in February and March. XRP is up ~6% year to date.\n\n[![XRP daily price since 2017](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content_image/data/64/640d97b277b5894f7ac33cc3e11e489c.png)](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/images/content_image/data/64/640d97b277b5894f7ac33cc3e11e489c.png)\n\nSign me up to receive email newsletters from **VettaFi Advisor Perspectives**\n\nEmail\\*\n\n## **Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP**\n\nAn index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories.
