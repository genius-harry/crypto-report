Other Ethereum-based memecoins pepe (PEPE) and mog (MOG), rose more than 5% — continuing to act as levered bets.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDon't miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Long & Short Newsletter today.

Tron’s TRX dipped after a surge 5% earlier in the day as memecoin trading picked up on the blockchain following a [no-fee update](https://www.coindesk.com/daybook-us/2025/03/19/crypto-daybook-americas-memecoins-take-off-on-tron-while-bitcoin-looks-to-fomc) in the Sunpump platform.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) rose 2% and remained steady under $84,000 in Asian evening hours ahead of the FOMC, where traders expect rates to be held steady. The $80,000 mark remains one to be watched, some say, as a break below would mean a critical support level vanishes.\n\nThe widely-watched ETH/BTC ratio - or the trading pair of ether against bitcoin - rose from 0.23 to 0.24 since Asian morning hours, indicative of a bump in demand for riskier ETH versus the perceived safety of bitcoin.\n\nEther rose on no immediate catalyst, but the mothership network has technical catalysts in the making. The Pectra upgrade, Ethereum's next major update, is currently in testing and aims to improve scalability, staking, and user experience with over 20 EIPs, including EIP-7702 (smart account functionality) and EIP-7251 (raising validator staking limits to 2,048 ETH).\n\nTesting began on Holesky in February 2025, followed by Sepolia in March, but faced challenges like transaction processing issues due to client incompatibilities. A new testnet, Hooli, launched on March 17, with Pectra testing scheduled for March 26.

This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.\n\n### What are altcoins?\n\nAltcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.\n\n### What are stablecoins?\n\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.\n\n### What is Bitcoin Dominance?\n\nBitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin’s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.\n\n* * *\n\nShare: [Cryptos feed](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/feed)\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

This level roughly coincides with the daily resistance level at $85,000, making it a key resistance zone. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it trades around $82,600.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator suggests a strength in momentum on the daily chart. The lower low in the [Bitcoin](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin) price formed on March 11 does not reflect the RSI higher high for the same period. This development is termed a bullish divergence, often leading to a trend reversal or short-term rally.\n\nIf bullish divergence plays a part and BTC closes above its 200-day EMA at $85,496, it could extend the recovery to $90,000.\n\n![BTC/USDT daily chart](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/BTCUSDT_2025-03-19_07-31-37-638779502549626319.png)\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart\n\nHowever, if BTC corrects and closes below $78,258 (February 28 low), it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $73,072.\n\n## **Ethereum could recover if its $1,861 level continues to hold as support**\n\nEthereum price was retested, and support was found around its daily level at $1,861 since last week. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it is trading slightly above $1,930.\n\nIf the daily support around $1,861 holds, the ETH price could extend the recovery to retest its March 7 high of $2,258.\n\nThe RSI on the daily chart reads 36 after bouncing off its oversold level of 30 last week, indicating fading bearish momentum. However, the RSI must move above its neutral level of 50 for the recovery rally to be sustained.\n\n![ETH/USDT daily chart](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/ETHUSDT_2025-03-19_08-02-34-638779502943417861.png)\n\nETH/USDT daily chart\n\nOn the other hand, if ETH breaks and closes below the daily support at $1,861, it could extend the decline to retest the next support level at $1,700.\n\n## **XRP momentum indicator displays indecisiveness among the traders**\n\nRipple price retested its daily support of $1.96 on March 11 and recovered 10.14% in the next 4 days. However, it faced resistance around the 50-day EMA at around the $2.50 level on Saturday, declining 4.38% until Tuesday. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it trades at around $2.27.\n\nIf XRP breaks and closes above the 50-day EMA at $2.50, it could extend the recovery to retest its $2.72 level.\n\nThe RSI on the daily [chart](https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart) reads 46, hovering around the neutral level of 50, indicating indecisiveness among the traders. For the bullish momentum to be sustained, the RSI must move above its neutral level of 50\n\n![XRP/USDT daily chart](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/XRPUSDT_2025-03-19_08-09-53-638779503329467111.png)\n\nXRP/USDT daily chart\n\nHowever, if XRP faces a correction and closes below $1.96 daily support, it could extend an additional decline to test its February 3 low of $1.77.\n\n## Bitcoin, altcoins, stablecoins FAQs\n\n### What is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.\n\n### What are altcoins?\n\nAltcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.\n\n### What are stablecoins?\n\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.\n\n### What is Bitcoin Dominance?\n\nBitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin’s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.\n\n* * *\n\nShare: [Cryptos feed](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/feed)\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Three of the most-watched (and most valuable) tokens today are **Bitcoin**( [BTC](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/btc/) -1.50%), **Ethereum**( [ETH](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/eth/) -5.08%) and **Dogecoin**( [DOGE](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/doge/) -6.28%). These digital assets have lost 2.9%, 2.8%, and 5.7%, respectively, over the past 24 hours as of 3 p.m. ET.\n\nThese moves have coincided with a broader pause in other risk assets ahead of what should be a very influential Federal Reserve decision tomorrow. But as is always the case with these high-flying assets, there's more to the story.\n\nLet's dive into some of the key drivers affecting demand for these three top cryptos today.\n\n## ETF flows generating outsized attention\n\nFollowing the post-Trump election victory, which saw Bitcoin rise to new all-time highs, and other top tokens like Ethereum and Dogecoin also see their fair share of upside, the performance of these top three cryptocurrencies has been overtly negative since Inauguration Day.\n\nSome of this depressed sentiment can be tied to spot ETF inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum. Among the notable reports I've seen come through is one detailing the surge of capital into gold-denominated ETFs and assets, with ETF outflows from various Bitcoin ETFs presumably flowing into these safe-haven funds.\n\nOne of the key investing theses held by long-term Bitcoin bulls (and to a certain extent, Ethereum holders as well) is that these digital assets carry some \"store of value\" properties that should provide demand even in the worst market environments. In fairness, we've yet to see how any cryptocurrency performs in a prolonged bear market (Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency, created in 2009 following the GFC).\n\nThat said, the fact that spot Bitcoin ETFs have given up their lead over gold ETFs (which was first gained late last year following the Trump election victory) is a trend worth noting. If more capital continues to flow out of this space, spot Ethereum ETFs (and future potential spot ETFs for Dogecoin and other assets) may have a much more negative outlook. Indeed, the recent news that two Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs are being liquidated by 21Shares adds to this narrative.\n\n## What to make of these recession concerns?\n\nI think the price action of all three major tokens today, and for the better part of the past two months, is really indicative of how investors view cryptocurrencies as an asset class in a potential recession. Right now, market participants are increasingly attempting to price new recession probabilities into their models. For top cryptos like these, their performance in a protracted downturn is really not known. That's adding to the uncertainty around owning these assets heading into what could be a turbulent back half of 2025.\n\nI think Bitcoin and Ethereum should have plenty of long-term upside. But I'm also aware that these assets have posted multiple 50%-plus drawdowns in the past, on lesser news than concerns around a potential recession. So investors will have to hone in on their investing timeline and what sort of levels they'd consider buying these assets at first before jumping in with both feet.\n\nMy view of Dogecoin is that this meme token is more of a speculative tool for traders to play sentiment to the upside and downside. Today's outsized move lower is indicative of how this token trades (with plenty of leveraged derivatives positions in the background driving these volatile moves).\n\nIf you're of the mind that more downside is likely, buying the dip with the world's two most valuable cryptocurrencies may be the strategy of choice.\n\n_[Chris MacDonald](https://www.fool.com/author/20447/) has positions in Ethereum.

Earlier in the day, however, they were up as much as 3.6%, 8.7%, and 4.7%, respectively. The **S&P 500** is up 0.8% and the **Nasdaq Composite** is up 1.1%.\n\nAll three cryptocurrencies got a boost from news that the SEC's appeal in its case against **XRP** would be dropped, a major step that confirms the Trump administration's softer approach to crypto regulation, boosting the whole market.\n\n## SEC backs off\n\n[Ripple, the company behind XRP](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/03/06/should-you-buy-xrp-while-its-under-250/), announced that the SEC is abandoning its appeal in the long-running legal battle against the company. The case dates back to 2020 when the SEC sued Ripple for allegedly selling unregistered securities. Ripple scored a partial victory last year when a judge ruled XRP wasn't a security when sold to retail investors -- though institutional sales were different.

The [altcoin](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/sec-pumps-breaks-on-altcoin-etfs-institutional-interest-remains-202503150730) gained nearly 2% on the day, and the momentum indicators on the daily price chart support gains in XRP.\n\nThe 50% [Fibonacci](https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci) retracement of XRP’s decline from the peak of $3.40 to the February low of $1.7711 — at $2.5856 — is a key resistance for the altcoin. A rally to this level could mark 10% gains in XRP.\n\nThe RSI reads 48 and is sloping upward, while the MACD flashes green histogram bars above the neutral line.\n\n[![XRP](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/XRPUSDT_2025-03-17_19-15-20-638778184138187957.png)](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/XRPUSDT_2025-03-17_19-15-20-638778184138187957.png)\n\nXRP/USDT daily price chart\n\nIn the event of a flash crash in Bitcoin, altcoins like XRP and Ether could face a correction. XRP could find support at the multi-month low of $1.7711 if there is a serious decline in the altcoin’s price.\n\n## Expert commentary on where Bitcoin and Ethereum are headed\n\nRyan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, told [FXStreet](https://www.fxstreet.com/) that the recent Bitcoin pullback put the spotlight on the $82,000 and $85,000 support levels.\n\n> Lee said, “It’s a classic post-rally consolidation phase that is healthy but also a test of whether Bitcoin’s recent momentum has real staying power. Institutional buying and the buzz around a potential US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve continue to prop up sentiment, but with resistance looming near $85,000–$90,000, a breakout won’t come easy.\n>\n> Let’s not forget the macro wildcard: any unexpected FOMC moves could throw a wrench into the market. If sentiment turns bearish, we could see Bitcoin dip toward $75,000–$80,000, though a bullish macro backdrop could send it climbing back to $90,000.”\n\nObserving that [Ethereum](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/ethereum) and Bitcoin are tightly correlated and the altcoin tends to respond to shifts in the BTC price trend, Lee told FXStreet:\n\n> “The ETH/BTC ratio’s weakness suggests Ethereum is struggling to find independent strength, even with promising developments on the horizon. The Pectra upgrade and ongoing Layer 2 expansion give it a bullish long-term case, but in the short term, those fundamentals might not be enough to break resistance at $2,300–$2,500 without Bitcoin leading the charge. If market sentiment sours, ETH could slip to $1,800, but Ethereum could push toward the top of its range if BTC stages a recovery. Right now, it’s a waiting game—does Bitcoin hold the line, or does the market need a deeper reset before the next leg up?”\n\n* * *\n\nShare:Share on WhatsAppShare on TelegramCopy to clipboardCopied\n\nLinkedin\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nReddit\n\n[Email](mailto:?body=Bitcoin%C2%A0%28BTC%29%C2%A0daily%C2%A0price%C2%A0chart%C2%A0shows%C2%A0signs%C2%A0of%C2%A0recovery%C2%A0in%C2%A0the%C2%A0largest%C2%A0cryptocurrency.%C2%A0%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fxstreet.com%2Fcryptocurrencies%2Fnews%2Ftop-3-price-prediction-bitcoin-ethereum-ripple-btc-eth-xrp-gain-as-microstrategy-buys-107-million-btc-202503171431&subject=Top%203%20Price%20Prediction%20Bitcoin,%20Ethereum,%20Ripple:%20BTC,%20ETH,%20XRP%20gain%20as%20MicroStrategy%20buys%20$10.7%20million%20BTC)\n[Cryptos feed](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/feed)\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Technical indicators on the BTC/USDT daily price chart support a thesis of gains in the largest cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) reads 42 and is sloping upward. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator flashes green histogram bars above the neutral line. The Bitcoin price trend has an underlying positive momentum on the daily timeframe.\n\nThe two key momentum indicators support Bitcoin’s gains, and a return to resistance at the $90,000 level is likely.\n\nBTC price is currently 8.35% away from the $90,000 resistance. The $90,000 level is key to Bitcoin price since the token has been hovering under this level since March 7, as observed in the BTC/USDT chart below:\n\n[![BTC/USDT](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/BTCUSDT_2025-03-17_18-32-22-638778183039557556.png)](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/BTCUSDT_2025-03-17_18-32-22-638778183039557556.png)\n\nBTC/USDT daily price chart\n\n## Ethereum could test psychologically important $2,000 level\n\nEthereum trades at $1,902 at the time of writing.

A successful daily [candlestick](https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart/candlestick-patterns) close above the $2,000 mark could push the altcoin toward resistance at the lower boundary of the Fair Value Gap (FVG) at $2,533.\n\nThe rally to $2,533 would mark an over 30% gain from the current ETH price.\n\nTwo key momentum indicators, the RSI and MACD, support Ether’s recent gains.

The [altcoin](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/sec-pumps-breaks-on-altcoin-etfs-institutional-interest-remains-202503150730) gained nearly 2% on the day, and the momentum indicators on the daily price chart support gains in XRP.\n\nThe 50% [Fibonacci](https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci) retracement of XRP’s decline from the peak of $3.40 to the February low of $1.7711 — at $2.5856 — is a key resistance for the altcoin. A rally to this level could mark 10% gains in XRP.\n\nThe RSI reads 48 and is sloping upward, while the MACD flashes green histogram bars above the neutral line.\n\n[![XRP](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/XRPUSDT_2025-03-17_19-15-20-638778184138187957.png)](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/XRPUSDT_2025-03-17_19-15-20-638778184138187957.png)\n\nXRP/USDT daily price chart\n\nIn the event of a flash crash in Bitcoin, altcoins like XRP and Ether could face a correction.

The active addresses in XRP, on the daily timeframe have climbed on Wednesday, after a negative spike on Tuesday, as noted by Santiment.\n\nThe mixed on-chain data suggests a slightly bullish outlook for Bitcoin and XRP and Ethereum price could remain stable or unchanged in the face of upcoming volatility in the prices of the top three cryptocurrencies with the looming FOMC interest rate decision.\n\n![Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP](https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2025/03/Bitcoin-BTC-15.35.01-19-Mar-2025.png)Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP on-chain analysis \\| Source: [Santiment](https://app.santiment.net/charts/cdySJuvR__sCl)\n\nOn the Bitcoin blockchain, the ratio of daily on-chain transactions in profits is nearly double that of transactions in losses, there is scope for profit-taking by traders who bought the token lower.

How do other countries explain the reluctance to adopt the BTC reserve?](https://crypto.news/why-did-south-korea-reject-a-bitcoin-reserve/)\n\n## Trump push and FOMC rate decision\n\nBitget CEO Gracy Chen told Crypto.news that Trump’s pro-crypto stance has left many traders puzzled. The idea of a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve is gaining traction and while the government is not buying Bitcoin yet, it could soon change.\n\n> “The Stablecoin bill is moving through Congress, signaling a major shift toward a blockchain-based financial system. Some big names, Elon Musk included, are exploring their own stablecoins, and Trump’s team sees stablecoins as a way to protect the dollar’s global reserve status.\n>\n> Then there’s the economy. Scott Bessent’s talk of a “detox period” suggests a controlled downturn might be ahead. If that’s the case, Trump’s playbook seems clear: blame the recession on Biden, use tariffs and crypto narratives to manage costs, and push for lower interest rates to fuel tech and AI growth. Short-term pain, long-term gain — that’s the strategy.”\n\nChen maintains an optimistic outlook on Bitcoin and predicts no fall under $70,000.\n\n> “Bitcoin price drop to possibly 73-78k \\[is likely\\], which is a solid time to enter for any buyers on the fence. In the next 1-2 years, BTC at 200k isn’t as far-fetched as most would think.”\n\nThe FOMC interest rate decision is looming, with the likelihood of higher volatility and price swings as traders react to the news.\n\nRyan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research told Crypto.news in a written note:\n\n> “The FOMC meeting on March 19, 2025, is expected to maintain the federal funds rate at 4.25%-4.50%, with the Fed taking a cautious, data-driven approach amid persistent inflation and solid economic growth.\n>\n> Crypto markets could see a short-term rally if the Fed signals future rate cuts, boosting risk appetite, or a dip if a hawkish stance reinforces tighter financial conditions. However, Bitcoin’s growing resilience and pro-crypto policy tailwinds might temper the broader market impact.”\n\nLee believes that volatility is likely around the announcement, it could be driven by Federal Reserve chair Powell’s remarks and updated rate projections.\n\n> “The crypto market may continue showing increasing independence from Fed decisions. Post-FOMC, Bitcoin is expected to trade within $80,000–$86,000 with 80% confidence, while Ethereum is projected to move between $1,800–$2,100 under the same confidence level. These ranges reflect potential fluctuations tied to macroeconomic signals, investor sentiment, and broader financial conditions.”\n\nYou might also like:\n[Nansen: Whales quietly buy Ethereum as prices stagnate](https://crypto.news/nansen-whales-quietly-buy-ethereum-as-prices-stagnate/)\n\n## Bitcoin eyes return to $87,000, Ethereum could climb to $2,100\n\nBitcoin could return to the $87,000 level as BTC shows signs of recovery on Wednesday.

Unlike previous bear markets, traders are seeing shorter bear cycles followed by sharp price rallies.\n\nThe upcoming FOMC meeting could usher higher volatility in the prices of top three cryptocurrencies and present buy the dip opportunities or offer opportunities for traders to take profits, amidst the prolonged bear market.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n## Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP trader sentiment turn risk-off\n\nBitcoin , Ethereum  and XRP  traders have reduced their activity in the derivatives market in the past 24 hours. Derivatives data from Coinglass shows a decline in trade volume, BTC and ETH trade volume declined nearly 11% and 7%. XRP noted a nearly 14% decline in trade volume in the same timeframe.\n\nCoinglass shows that traders have turned risk-averse following nearly $89 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours in the top three cryptocurrencies.\n\n![Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP](https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-19-at-3.25.51%E2%80%AFPM.png)Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP derivatives data \\| Source: [Coinglass](https://www.coinglass.com/)\n\nOpen Interest, another key derivatives metric, the combined value of all open contracts in a given token climbed by 1.42%, 4.90% and 1.49% respectively for the top three cryptos BTC, ETH and XRP.\n\n## BTC, ETH, XRP on-chain analysis\n\nOn-chain analysis for the top three cryptocurrencies on Santiment shows that Binance funding rate for Bitcoin has been positive for three consecutive days in a row. Meaning Bitcoin derivatives traders expect price to appreciate, even as they reduce their activity in the token, as gathered by Coinglass data.\n\nEthereum supply held by whales, excluding exchanges, sees no significant change, while Bitcoin supply held by funds has reduced consistently. The active addresses in XRP, on the daily timeframe have climbed on Wednesday, after a negative spike on Tuesday, as noted by Santiment.\n\nThe mixed on-chain data suggests a slightly bullish outlook for Bitcoin and XRP and Ethereum price could remain stable or unchanged in the face of upcoming volatility in the prices of the top three cryptocurrencies with the looming FOMC interest rate decision.\n\n![Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP](https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2025/03/Bitcoin-BTC-15.35.01-19-Mar-2025.png)Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP on-chain analysis \\| Source: [Santiment](https://app.santiment.net/charts/cdySJuvR__sCl)\n\nOn the Bitcoin blockchain, the ratio of daily on-chain transactions in profits is nearly double that of transactions in losses, there is scope for profit-taking by traders who bought the token lower. In the case of Ethereum, there is a slight uptick in the supply in profit and the same has been observed in XRP.\n\nEthereum and XRP both offer limited profit-taking opportunities for traders, as seen in the chart below.\n\n![Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP](https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2025/03/Bitcoin-BTC-15.38.03-19-Mar-2025.png)Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP on-chain analysis \\| Source: [Santiment](https://app.santiment.net/charts/cdySJuvR__sCl)\n\nYou might also like:\n[Why did South Korea reject a Bitcoin reserve? How do other countries explain the reluctance to adopt the BTC reserve?](https://crypto.news/why-did-south-korea-reject-a-bitcoin-reserve/)\n\n## Trump push and FOMC rate decision\n\nBitget CEO Gracy Chen told Crypto.news that Trump’s pro-crypto stance has left many traders puzzled. The idea of a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve is gaining traction and while the government is not buying Bitcoin yet, it could soon change.\n\n> “The Stablecoin bill is moving through Congress, signaling a major shift toward a blockchain-based financial system. Some big names, Elon Musk included, are exploring their own stablecoins, and Trump’s team sees stablecoins as a way to protect the dollar’s global reserve status.\n>\n> Then there’s the economy. Scott Bessent’s talk of a “detox period” suggests a controlled downturn might be ahead. If that’s the case, Trump’s playbook seems clear: blame the recession on Biden, use tariffs and crypto narratives to manage costs, and push for lower interest rates to fuel tech and AI growth. Short-term pain, long-term gain — that’s the strategy.”\n\nChen maintains an optimistic outlook on Bitcoin and predicts no fall under $70,000.\n\n> “Bitcoin price drop to possibly 73-78k \\[is likely\\], which is a solid time to enter for any buyers on the fence. In the next 1-2 years, BTC at 200k isn’t as far-fetched as most would think.”\n\nThe FOMC interest rate decision is looming, with the likelihood of higher volatility and price swings as traders react to the news.\n\nRyan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research told Crypto.news in a written note:\n\n> “The FOMC meeting on March 19, 2025, is expected to maintain the federal funds rate at 4.25%-4.50%, with the Fed taking a cautious, data-driven approach amid persistent inflation and solid economic growth.\n>\n> Crypto markets could see a short-term rally if the Fed signals future rate cuts, boosting risk appetite, or a dip if a hawkish stance reinforces tighter financial conditions. However, Bitcoin’s growing resilience and pro-crypto policy tailwinds might temper the broader market impact.”\n\nLee believes that volatility is likely around the announcement, it could be driven by Federal Reserve chair Powell’s remarks and updated rate projections.\n\n> “The crypto market may continue showing increasing independence from Fed decisions. Post-FOMC, Bitcoin is expected to trade within $80,000–$86,000 with 80% confidence, while Ethereum is projected to move between $1,800–$2,100 under the same confidence level. These ranges reflect potential fluctuations tied to macroeconomic signals, investor sentiment, and broader financial conditions.”\n\nYou might also like:\n[Nansen: Whales quietly buy Ethereum as prices stagnate](https://crypto.news/nansen-whales-quietly-buy-ethereum-as-prices-stagnate/)\n\n## Bitcoin eyes return to $87,000, Ethereum could climb to $2,100\n\nBitcoin could return to the $87,000 level as BTC shows signs of recovery on Wednesday. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $83,517, and technical indicators on the daily timeframe show likelihood of gains in the token.\n\nBitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) reads 44 and is sloping upwards, supporting a thesis of positive momentum underlying the token’s price trend.

But sometimes, certain gargantuan investors, or groups of them, can bring so much capital to bear that their behavior is worth understanding in detail -- especially when they're accumulating relatively volatile assets like **Bitcoin**( [BTC](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/btc/) -1.50%) and **Ethereum**( [ETH](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/eth/) -5.08%).\n\nThere's one particular and relatively new pattern of behavior among a group of major investors that's important to know about. It might not push the prices of these coins up indefinitely, but it's already having an effect.\n\nArrows-InCollapse\n\n![](https://g.foolcdn.com/art/companylogos/mark/BTC.png)\n\n## [CRYPTO: BTC](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/btc/)\n\nBitcoin\n\nToday's Change\n\n(-1.50%) -$1,309.88\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$86,186.00\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nYTD1w1m3m6m1y\n5y\n\n\n+1370.09%\n\n\nPrice\n\nVS S&P\n\n\nBTC\n\n\n### Key Data Points\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$1.7T\n\nDay's Range\n\n$85,846.00 - $87,724.00\n\n52wk Range\n\n$49,221.15 - $108,785.53\n\nVolume\n\n24,314,428,810\n\nAvg Vol\n\nGross Margin\n\n0.00%\n\nDividend Yield\n\nN/A\n\n## Geopolitics are now undeniably a big part of crypto markets\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are assets with a global distribution. That means that in most major economies, people and businesses buy, hold, and sell them, even if it isn't fully legal to do so. In many major countries, cryptocurrency exchanges are operating legally as well. But even fully legal exchanges within well-defined regulatory regimes can be used for illegal or otherwise less-than-wholesome purposes, like dodging international sanctions or [money laundering](https://www.fool.com/terms/m/money-laundering/).\n\nRussia extracts, refines, and sells a lot of oil. In terms of dollars, Russia's oil trade was worth $192 billion in 2024; the country's native currency is the ruble. Much of that trade is oil sales to India, which uses the rupee as its currency, and China, which uses the yuan. But due to international sanctions on Russia stemming from its war against Ukraine, selling oil in exchange for rupees or yuan directly is not as easy as it used to be, as it'd entail violating sanctions.\n\nSo now, per Reuters reporting in mid-March, Russian oil businesses are using Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies to facilitate their payments and evade the barriers to trade posed by the sanctions.\n\nTo illustrate how this process works, let's say that a company in India wants to buy oil from Russia. First, the company pays a sketchy middleman, typically a shell company, in rupees. Then, that middleman exchanges the rupees for Bitcoin, Ethereum, or a [stablecoin](https://www.fool.com/terms/s/stablecoins/). This is an action that is not in and of itself in violation of any sanctions, so it isn't inhibited in any way at the point of the exchange. Next, the cryptocurrency is sent to the Russian business selling oil. That business then sells its crypto to convert it into rubles.\n\nThe payment is cleared, and the oil is transferred accordingly, effectively skirting the sanctions. One Russian crypto exchange faced sanctions from the U.S. and European Union for facilitating this type of workaround in 2022. This ultimately led to it shutting down in early March of this year after some of its stablecoin [wallet addresses](https://www.fool.com/terms/b/blockchain-wallet/) were blocked by the coin's issuer. However, it's very likely that other exchanges are still in operation, and that more can spring up to take the fallen one's place.\n\nTherefore, investors should calculate that the sanctions evasion trade is more likely to continue using Bitcoin and Ethereum than it is with stablecoins moving forward. This will create buying pressure for those two coins for as long as the sanctions last, and perhaps even beyond that.\n\nThe force of that pressure may be substantial, depending on future demand for Russian oil.\n\nArrows-InCollapse\n\n![](https://g.foolcdn.com/art/companylogos/mark/ETH.png)\n\n## [CRYPTO: ETH](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/eth/)\n\nEthereum\n\nToday's Change\n\n(-5.08%) -$102.91\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$1,923.77\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nYTD1w1m3m6m1y\n5y\n\n\nPrice\n\nVS S&P\n\n\n### Key Data Points\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$231B\n\nDay's Range\n\n$1,914.40 - $2,034.03\n\n52wk Range\n\n$1,791.23 - $4,089.23\n\nVolume\n\n14,934,073,509\n\nAvg Vol\n\nGross Margin\n\n0.00%\n\nDividend Yield\n\nN/A\n\n## This could unravel explosively\n\nCryptocurrency's legal status in Russia is shifting in real time. Its central bank just implemented a three-year pilot program enabling wealthy investors to trade cryptos and derivative financial instruments. The ongoing process is bound to have implications for how the country's domestic businesses can use Bitcoin and Ethereum to avoid sanctions.\n\nThus, most investors shouldn't commit to buying significant quantities of Bitcoin and Ethereum based solely on the evasion trade. It's unclear how long Russia will be facing sanctions, so the buying pressure represented by its oil companies may taper off suddenly, causing prices to fall or be more volatile than usual. It's also unclear if there will be attempts at enforcing the sanctions, given the nature of the particular cryptos used.\n\nBut, like it or not, this saga supports one of the key pillars of Bitcoin's value, which is that it's a form of money that's not subject to the oversight of any one country in the way that [fiat currencies](https://www.fool.com/terms/f/fiat-currency/) are. If it were like fiat currencies and not independent of governments, there'd be a large probability of a central issuing authority blocking the wallet addresses of known sanctions evaders. The whole point of the Russian oil businesses using Bitcoin here is that there's not any authority to say they aren't allowed to do what they're doing. That confirmation of part of its [investment thesis](https://www.fool.com/terms/i/investment-thesis/) could be seen as another reason to buy it, provided that the intention is to hold it for the long term.\n\nWith Ethereum, this new driver is less relevant, and less likely to be sustained. While purchasing from sanction-dodgers could still generate higher prices over the coming months and perhaps even years, the existence of a relatively altruistic senior leadership team in the form of the Ethereum Foundation suggests that there might be some effort to adapt the chain such that it can't be used for nefarious purposes.\n\nIf you buy it to capture value from the evasion trade, the upside could be very short-lived, with a painful correction on the other side. Therefore, it isn't a good idea.\n\n_[Alex Carchidi](https://www.fool.com/author/20287/) has positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Bitcoin and Ethereum.

That means that in most major economies, people and businesses buy, hold, and sell them, even if it isn't fully legal to do so. In many major countries, cryptocurrency exchanges are operating legally as well. But even fully legal exchanges within well-defined regulatory regimes can be used for illegal or otherwise less-than-wholesome purposes, like dodging international sanctions or [money laundering](https://www.fool.com/terms/m/money-laundering/).\n\nRussia extracts, refines, and sells a lot of oil. In terms of dollars, Russia's oil trade was worth $192 billion in 2024; the country's native currency is the ruble. Much of that trade is oil sales to India, which uses the rupee as its currency, and China, which uses the yuan. But due to international sanctions on Russia stemming from its war against Ukraine, selling oil in exchange for rupees or yuan directly is not as easy as it used to be, as it'd entail violating sanctions.\n\nSo now, per Reuters reporting in mid-March, Russian oil businesses are using Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies to facilitate their payments and evade the barriers to trade posed by the sanctions.\n\nTo illustrate how this process works, let's say that a company in India wants to buy oil from Russia. First, the company pays a sketchy middleman, typically a shell company, in rupees. Then, that middleman exchanges the rupees for Bitcoin, Ethereum, or a [stablecoin](https://www.fool.com/terms/s/stablecoins/). This is an action that is not in and of itself in violation of any sanctions, so it isn't inhibited in any way at the point of the exchange. Next, the cryptocurrency is sent to the Russian business selling oil. That business then sells its crypto to convert it into rubles.\n\nThe payment is cleared, and the oil is transferred accordingly, effectively skirting the sanctions. One Russian crypto exchange faced sanctions from the U.S. and European Union for facilitating this type of workaround in 2022. This ultimately led to it shutting down in early March of this year after some of its stablecoin [wallet addresses](https://www.fool.com/terms/b/blockchain-wallet/) were blocked by the coin's issuer. However, it's very likely that other exchanges are still in operation, and that more can spring up to take the fallen one's place.\n\nTherefore, investors should calculate that the sanctions evasion trade is more likely to continue using Bitcoin and Ethereum than it is with stablecoins moving forward. This will create buying pressure for those two coins for as long as the sanctions last, and perhaps even beyond that.\n\nThe force of that pressure may be substantial, depending on future demand for Russian oil.\n\nArrows-InCollapse\n\n![](https://g.foolcdn.com/art/companylogos/mark/ETH.png)\n\n## [CRYPTO: ETH](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/eth/)\n\nEthereum\n\nToday's Change\n\n(-5.08%) -$102.91\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$1,923.77\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nYTD1w1m3m6m1y\n5y\n\n\nPrice\n\nVS S&P\n\n\n### Key Data Points\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$231B\n\nDay's Range\n\n$1,914.40 - $2,034.03\n\n52wk Range\n\n$1,791.23 - $4,089.23\n\nVolume\n\n14,934,073,509\n\nAvg Vol\n\nGross Margin\n\n0.00%\n\nDividend Yield\n\nN/A\n\n## This could unravel explosively\n\nCryptocurrency's legal status in Russia is shifting in real time. Its central bank just implemented a three-year pilot program enabling wealthy investors to trade cryptos and derivative financial instruments. The ongoing process is bound to have implications for how the country's domestic businesses can use Bitcoin and Ethereum to avoid sanctions.\n\nThus, most investors shouldn't commit to buying significant quantities of Bitcoin and Ethereum based solely on the evasion trade. It's unclear how long Russia will be facing sanctions, so the buying pressure represented by its oil companies may taper off suddenly, causing prices to fall or be more volatile than usual. It's also unclear if there will be attempts at enforcing the sanctions, given the nature of the particular cryptos used.\n\nBut, like it or not, this saga supports one of the key pillars of Bitcoin's value, which is that it's a form of money that's not subject to the oversight of any one country in the way that [fiat currencies](https://www.fool.com/terms/f/fiat-currency/) are. If it were like fiat currencies and not independent of governments, there'd be a large probability of a central issuing authority blocking the wallet addresses of known sanctions evaders. The whole point of the Russian oil businesses using Bitcoin here is that there's not any authority to say they aren't allowed to do what they're doing. That confirmation of part of its [investment thesis](https://www.fool.com/terms/i/investment-thesis/) could be seen as another reason to buy it, provided that the intention is to hold it for the long term.\n\nWith Ethereum, this new driver is less relevant, and less likely to be sustained. While purchasing from sanction-dodgers could still generate higher prices over the coming months and perhaps even years, the existence of a relatively altruistic senior leadership team in the form of the Ethereum Foundation suggests that there might be some effort to adapt the chain such that it can't be used for nefarious purposes.\n\nIf you buy it to capture value from the evasion trade, the upside could be very short-lived, with a painful correction on the other side.

While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational [differences that investors should know](https://www.etftrends.com/crypto-channel/bitcoin-ether-differences-etf-investors-should-know/). We've also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency), a cryptocurrency is \"a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.\"\n\n_For a better understanding of crypto market cycles, read more [here](https://www.etftrends.com/crypto-channel/understanding-crypto-market-cycles/)._\n\n## **Bitcoin**\n\nBitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide to a mainstream financial asset. It is often considered volatile, as seen in our first chart, but one can argue that it is also [resilient](https://www.etftrends.com/crypto-channel/understanding-bitcoins-resilience/).

We've also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency), a cryptocurrency is \"a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.\"\n\n_For a better understanding of crypto market cycles, read more [here](https://www.etftrends.com/crypto-channel/understanding-crypto-market-cycles/)._\n\n## **Bitcoin**\n\nBitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency.

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.\n\n1080 Views\n\nRussia has started using crypto for oil trades with China and India as it seeks to bypass Western sanctions, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-leans-cryptocurrencies-oil-trade-sources-say-2025-03-14/) on March 14, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n\nAccording to the report, some Russian oil companies have settled trades in [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/), [Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/), and stablecoins like Tether’s [USDT](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/). This strategy simplifies the conversion of Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupees into Russian Rubles, enabling smoother transactions despite financial restrictions.\n\nTypically, a Chinese buyer deposits Yuan into an offshore account controlled by an intermediary. The funds are then converted into crypto and transferred through multiple accounts before reaching a final destination in Russia, where they are exchanged for Rubles.\n\nThese transactions reportedly reach tens of millions of dollars per month.\n\nAlthough crypto adoption in Russia’s oil trade remains limited, it is [part of a broader trend](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-firms-turn-to-bitcoin-stablecoins-for-global-trade-amid-sanctions/). Over the past year, the country has [introduced new regulations](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-contemplating-permanently-legalizing-stablecoins-for-cross-border-payments/) governing [crypto mining](https://cryptoslate.com/russias-bitcoin-mining-demand-triples-amid-regulatory-shifts-and-price-rally/), taxation, and international trade.\n\n[Western sanctions imposed over Russia’s](https://cryptoslate.com/tether-freezes-27m-on-garantex-forcing-halt-of-russian-linked-exchange/) military actions in Ukraine have accelerated this shift toward digital assets. However, industry sources suggest oil firms may continue using cryptocurrencies even if sanctions are lifted due to their efficiency and transaction speed.\n\n## Digital rubles challenges\n\nWhile Russia increases its reliance on crypto for trade, its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project is facing significant hurdles.\n\nLast month, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina [announced](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-delays-digital-ruble-cbdc-launch-extends-pilot-phase-indefinitely/) an indefinite delay in the launch of the digital ruble. She attributed the setback to the need for further refinements to ensure that the currency benefits all stakeholders.\n\nHowever, a recent survey indicates that the digital ruble launch was postponed due to the inadequate IT infrastructure of banks that were expected to handle the project.\n\nThe survey of Russian banking experts revealed that 30% of financial institutions are not yet prepared to support the digital ruble. Experts explained that implementing the CBDC requires banks to upgrade their IT systems to handle increased transaction volumes.\n\nMeanwhile, 20% of banking IT specialists stated that their systems are fully equipped for the digital ruble. Another 50% said they are partially prepared but need further upgrades.\n\nAt the same time, around 14% of the respondents expressed concerns over potential information security risks associated with the currency.\n\nGiven these challenges, Russia’s national digital asset initiative could face further obstacles unless major financial institutions fully prepare for its adoption.\n\n###### Mentioned in this article\n\n[![Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2020/imgresize/timthumb.php?src=https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bitcoin-logo.jpg&w=32&h=32&q=75)Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/) [![Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2020/imgresize/timthumb.php?src=https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ethereum-logo-2022.jpg&w=32&h=32&q=75)Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/) [![Tether](https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2020/imgresize/timthumb.php?src=https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tether-logo.jpg&w=32&h=32&q=75)Tether](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/) [![Tether Limited](https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2020/imgresize/timthumb.php?src=https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Tether-EURt-logo.png&w=32&h=32&q=75)Tether Limited](https://cryptoslate.com/companies/tether/)\n\n[![XRP Turbo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201280%20453%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://link.cryptoslate.com/xrpturbo)\n\nPosted In: [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/news/bitcoin/), [China](https://cryptoslate.com/places/china/), [India](https://cryptoslate.com/places/india/), [Russia](https://cryptoslate.com/places/russia/), [Adoption](https://cryptoslate.com/adoption/), [Crypto](https://cryptoslate.com/crypto/), [Featured](https://cryptoslate.com/featured-news/)\n\nPeople were interested in these podcasts\n\n[Discover more podcasts →](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-oil-firms-using-bitcoin-and-ethereum-for-cross-border-payments-with-china/#)\n\nPlay Episode\n\n37min\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nJoe Consorti on Bitcoin's role in global macroeconomics\n\nBitcoin and Macro analyst Joe Consorti joins to dig into how US macro data is impacting Bitcoin and the latest on the Bitcoin reserve.Credits\n\nThanks to Liam 'Akiba' Wright for hosting and producing the episodes.\n\n\n\nConnect with CryptoSlate:\n\n\\- X\n\\- Substack\n\\- Google News\n\\- Telegram\n\\- Instagram\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nPhillip Alexeev on CrossFi: The bridge between crypto and traditional banking\n\nIn a recent episode of SlateCast, Phillip Alexeev, Chief Growth Officer at CrossFi, joined CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill to discuss the platform's innovative solutions to integrate crypto with traditional finance. CrossFi’s mission is to provide seamless financial inclusivity through a robust ecosystem that supports non-custodial crypto transactions, partnerships with banks, and scalable blockchain technology.Alexeev described CrossFi as “the Apple Pay for crypto,” emphasizing its role as a bridge between decentralized finance (DeFi) and mainstream banking.“Our focus has always been empowering users by removing gatekeepers while providing access to advanced financial tools,” he said.Non-Custodial Payments RedefinedAt its core, CrossFi offers a unique payment technology enabling users to transact directly from their Web3 wallets at any point-of-sale terminal worldwide. This approach eliminates the need for custodial platforms, maintaining users’ control over their funds. Alexeev highlighted the platform's ability to “connect any Web3 wallet to the CrossFi app,” facilitating crypto-to-fiat transactions seamlessly and securely.Unlike traditional crypto cards, CrossFi partners directly with banks to interact with smart contracts, bypassing third-party intermediaries.“We’ve designed an ecosystem with fewer points of failure while forcing banks to innovate and adopt crypto technology,” Alexeev explained.Why Build a New Layer-1 Blockchain?Addressing the decision to build a proprietary layer-1 blockchain, Alexeev acknowledged the challenges of integrating blockchain with existing banking infrastructure.“No existing blockchain met the security, scalability, and compatibility requirements of traditional banks,” he stated.The customized blockchain allows CrossFi to support seamless interaction between decentralized technologies and institutional frameworks.Flat Fees for TransparencyCrossFi aims to disrupt conventional payment systems\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nBuilding the decentralized data layer with Powerloom’s Swaroop Hegde\n\nSwaroop Hegde, CEO and Co-Founder of Powerloom, joined CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief, Liam “Akiba” Wright, and CEO Nate Whitehill on The SlateCast to discuss the future of decentralized data layers. Backed by notable names like Blockchain Capital and Filecoin, Powerloom is setting a new standard for composable and decentralized data solutions, reshaping how users interact with on-chain data and fostering innovation across web3 applications.The Challenge of Reliable On-Chain DataSwaroop began by highlighting the current inefficiencies in accessing and verifying on-chain data. Traditional methods rely heavily on centralized sources, such as CoinMarketCap or specific blockchain dashboards, leading to potential data manipulation and outdated information.“Most of the usage when it goes outside of the dApp is actually coming from some sort of centralized indexer,”Swaroop noted, emphasizing the vulnerabilities inherent in such a setup.Powerloom addresses these issues with a decentralized node network, enabling real-time data computation without the need for a centralized intermediary.“With over 5,300 nodes, even non-technical users can contribute to the network, ensuring verifiability and reliability,” he explained.Powerloom’s Unique Approach to Data CompositionUnlike traditional indexers, Powerloom operates on a demand-driven system that aggregates data atomically. Swaroop explained,“We don’t sit and index all the data. Instead, we focus on composing data dynamically based on demand.”This approach allows Powerloom to cater to a variety of use cases, from trading data to lending rates across multiple chains.The platform’s composability extends beyond Uniswap and Aave, creating “data markets” that empower users to craft personalized queries and insights. These markets are decentralized and verifiable, ensuring users can trust the integrity of their data.Introducing Generative Prediction Markets (GPM)A standout feature discussed was Powerloom’s Generative Prediction Markets\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nGiovanni Santostani explains Bitcoin Models and Power Law's expansion\n\nBitcoin Power Law Theory creator Giovanni Santostani refutes some criticisms of his Bitcoin models and explains how the power law expands within the Bitcoin ecosystem.Credits\n\nThanks to Liam 'Akiba' Wright for hosting and producing the episodes.\n\n\n\nConnect with CryptoSlate:\n\n\\- X\n\\- Substack\n\\- Google News\n\\- Telegram\n\\- Instagram\n\n[Ad](https://cryptoslate.com/partnerships/)\n\n[![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2096%2096%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\\\\n\\\\\nCryptoSlate on Xx.com/cryptoslate\\\\\n\\\\\nGet the latest crypto news and expert insights.

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.\n\n1080 Views\n\nRussia has started using crypto for oil trades with China and India as it seeks to bypass Western sanctions, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-leans-cryptocurrencies-oil-trade-sources-say-2025-03-14/) on March 14, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n\nAccording to the report, some Russian oil companies have settled trades in [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/), [Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/), and stablecoins like Tether’s [USDT](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/). This strategy simplifies the conversion of Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupees into Russian Rubles, enabling smoother transactions despite financial restrictions.\n\nTypically, a Chinese buyer deposits Yuan into an offshore account controlled by an intermediary. The funds are then converted into crypto and transferred through multiple accounts before reaching a final destination in Russia, where they are exchanged for Rubles.\n\nThese transactions reportedly reach tens of millions of dollars per month.\n\nAlthough crypto adoption in Russia’s oil trade remains limited, it is [part of a broader trend](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-firms-turn-to-bitcoin-stablecoins-for-global-trade-amid-sanctions/). Over the past year, the country has [introduced new regulations](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-contemplating-permanently-legalizing-stablecoins-for-cross-border-payments/) governing [crypto mining](https://cryptoslate.com/russias-bitcoin-mining-demand-triples-amid-regulatory-shifts-and-price-rally/), taxation, and international trade.\n\n[Western sanctions imposed over Russia’s](https://cryptoslate.com/tether-freezes-27m-on-garantex-forcing-halt-of-russian-linked-exchange/) military actions in Ukraine have accelerated this shift toward digital assets. However, industry sources suggest oil firms may continue using cryptocurrencies even if sanctions are lifted due to their efficiency and transaction speed.\n\n## Digital rubles challenges\n\nWhile Russia increases its reliance on crypto for trade, its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project is facing significant hurdles.\n\nLast month, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina [announced](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-delays-digital-ruble-cbdc-launch-extends-pilot-phase-indefinitely/) an indefinite delay in the launch of the digital ruble. She attributed the setback to the need for further refinements to ensure that the currency benefits all stakeholders.\n\nHowever, a recent survey indicates that the digital ruble launch was postponed due to the inadequate IT infrastructure of banks that were expected to handle the project.\n\nThe survey of Russian banking experts revealed that 30% of financial institutions are not yet prepared to support the digital ruble. Experts explained that implementing the CBDC requires banks to upgrade their IT systems to handle increased transaction volumes.\n\nMeanwhile, 20% of banking IT specialists stated that their systems are fully equipped for the digital ruble. Another 50% said they are partially prepared but need further upgrades.\n\nAt the same time, around 14% of the respondents expressed concerns over potential information security risks associated with the currency.\n\nGiven these challenges, Russia’s national digital asset initiative could face further obstacles unless major financial institutions fully prepare for its adoption.\n\n###### Mentioned in this article\n\n[![Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2020/imgresize/timthumb.php?src=https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bitcoin-logo.jpg&w=32&h=32&q=75)Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/) [![Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2020/imgresize/timthumb.php?src=https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ethereum-logo-2022.jpg&w=32&h=32&q=75)Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/) [![Tether](https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2020/imgresize/timthumb.php?src=https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tether-logo.jpg&w=32&h=32&q=75)Tether](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/) [![Tether Limited](https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2020/imgresize/timthumb.php?src=https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Tether-EURt-logo.png&w=32&h=32&q=75)Tether Limited](https://cryptoslate.com/companies/tether/)\n\n[![XRP Turbo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201280%20453%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://link.cryptoslate.com/xrpturbo)\n\nPosted In: [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/news/bitcoin/), [China](https://cryptoslate.com/places/china/), [India](https://cryptoslate.com/places/india/), [Russia](https://cryptoslate.com/places/russia/), [Adoption](https://cryptoslate.com/adoption/), [Crypto](https://cryptoslate.com/crypto/), [Featured](https://cryptoslate.com/featured-news/)\n\nPeople were interested in these podcasts\n\n[Discover more podcasts →](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-oil-firms-using-bitcoin-and-ethereum-for-cross-border-payments-with-china/#)\n\nPlay Episode\n\n37min\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nJoe Consorti on Bitcoin's role in global macroeconomics\n\nBitcoin and Macro analyst Joe Consorti joins to dig into how US macro data is impacting Bitcoin and the latest on the Bitcoin reserve.Credits\n\nThanks to Liam 'Akiba' Wright for hosting and producing the episodes.\n\n\n\nConnect with CryptoSlate:\n\n\\- X\n\\- Substack\n\\- Google News\n\\- Telegram\n\\- Instagram\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nPhillip Alexeev on CrossFi: The bridge between crypto and traditional banking\n\nIn a recent episode of SlateCast, Phillip Alexeev, Chief Growth Officer at CrossFi, joined CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill to discuss the platform's innovative solutions to integrate crypto with traditional finance. CrossFi’s mission is to provide seamless financial inclusivity through a robust ecosystem that supports non-custodial crypto transactions, partnerships with banks, and scalable blockchain technology.Alexeev described CrossFi as “the Apple Pay for crypto,” emphasizing its role as a bridge between decentralized finance (DeFi) and mainstream banking.“Our focus has always been empowering users by removing gatekeepers while providing access to advanced financial tools,” he said.Non-Custodial Payments RedefinedAt its core, CrossFi offers a unique payment technology enabling users to transact directly from their Web3 wallets at any point-of-sale terminal worldwide. This approach eliminates the need for custodial platforms, maintaining users’ control over their funds. Alexeev highlighted the platform's ability to “connect any Web3 wallet to the CrossFi app,” facilitating crypto-to-fiat transactions seamlessly and securely.Unlike traditional crypto cards, CrossFi partners directly with banks to interact with smart contracts, bypassing third-party intermediaries.“We’ve designed an ecosystem with fewer points of failure while forcing banks to innovate and adopt crypto technology,” Alexeev explained.Why Build a New Layer-1 Blockchain?Addressing the decision to build a proprietary layer-1 blockchain, Alexeev acknowledged the challenges of integrating blockchain with existing banking infrastructure.“No existing blockchain met the security, scalability, and compatibility requirements of traditional banks,” he stated.The customized blockchain allows CrossFi to support seamless interaction between decentralized technologies and institutional frameworks.Flat Fees for TransparencyCrossFi aims to disrupt conventional payment systems\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nBuilding the decentralized data layer with Powerloom’s Swaroop Hegde\n\nSwaroop Hegde, CEO and Co-Founder of Powerloom, joined CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief, Liam “Akiba” Wright, and CEO Nate Whitehill on The SlateCast to discuss the future of decentralized data layers. Backed by notable names like Blockchain Capital and Filecoin, Powerloom is setting a new standard for composable and decentralized data solutions, reshaping how users interact with on-chain data and fostering innovation across web3 applications.The Challenge of Reliable On-Chain DataSwaroop began by highlighting the current inefficiencies in accessing and verifying on-chain data. Traditional methods rely heavily on centralized sources, such as CoinMarketCap or specific blockchain dashboards, leading to potential data manipulation and outdated information.“Most of the usage when it goes outside of the dApp is actually coming from some sort of centralized indexer,”Swaroop noted, emphasizing the vulnerabilities inherent in such a setup.Powerloom addresses these issues with a decentralized node network, enabling real-time data computation without the need for a centralized intermediary.“With over 5,300 nodes, even non-technical users can contribute to the network, ensuring verifiability and reliability,” he explained.Powerloom’s Unique Approach to Data CompositionUnlike traditional indexers, Powerloom operates on a demand-driven system that aggregates data atomically. Swaroop explained,“We don’t sit and index all the data. Instead, we focus on composing data dynamically based on demand.”This approach allows Powerloom to cater to a variety of use cases, from trading data to lending rates across multiple chains.The platform’s composability extends beyond Uniswap and Aave, creating “data markets” that empower users to craft personalized queries and insights. These markets are decentralized and verifiable, ensuring users can trust the integrity of their data.Introducing Generative Prediction Markets (GPM)A standout feature discussed was Powerloom’s Generative Prediction Markets\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nGiovanni Santostani explains Bitcoin Models and Power Law's expansion\n\nBitcoin Power Law Theory creator Giovanni Santostani refutes some criticisms of his Bitcoin models and explains how the power law expands within the Bitcoin ecosystem.Credits\n\nThanks to Liam 'Akiba' Wright for hosting and producing the episodes.\n\n\n\nConnect with CryptoSlate:\n\n\\- X\n\\- Substack\n\\- Google News\n\\- Telegram\n\\- Instagram\n\n[Ad](https://cryptoslate.com/partnerships/)\n\n[![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2096%2096%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\\\\n\\\\\nCryptoSlate on Xx.com/cryptoslate\\\\\n\\\\\nGet the latest crypto news and expert insights.

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.\n\n1080 Views\n\nRussia has started using crypto for oil trades with China and India as it seeks to bypass Western sanctions, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-leans-cryptocurrencies-oil-trade-sources-say-2025-03-14/) on March 14, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n\nAccording to the report, some Russian oil companies have settled trades in [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/), [Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/), and stablecoins like Tether’s [USDT](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/). This strategy simplifies the conversion of Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupees into Russian Rubles, enabling smoother transactions despite financial restrictions.\n\nTypically, a Chinese buyer deposits Yuan into an offshore account controlled by an intermediary. The funds are then converted into crypto and transferred through multiple accounts before reaching a final destination in Russia, where they are exchanged for Rubles.\n\nThese transactions reportedly reach tens of millions of dollars per month.\n\nAlthough crypto adoption in Russia’s oil trade remains limited, it is [part of a broader trend](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-firms-turn-to-bitcoin-stablecoins-for-global-trade-amid-sanctions/). Over the past year, the country has [introduced new regulations](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-contemplating-permanently-legalizing-stablecoins-for-cross-border-payments/) governing [crypto mining](https://cryptoslate.com/russias-bitcoin-mining-demand-triples-amid-regulatory-shifts-and-price-rally/), taxation, and international trade.\n\n[Western sanctions imposed over Russia’s](https://cryptoslate.com/tether-freezes-27m-on-garantex-forcing-halt-of-russian-linked-exchange/) military actions in Ukraine have accelerated this shift toward digital assets. However, industry sources suggest oil firms may continue using cryptocurrencies even if sanctions are lifted due to their efficiency and transaction speed.\n\n## Digital rubles challenges\n\nWhile Russia increases its reliance on crypto for trade, its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project is facing significant hurdles.\n\nLast month, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina [announced](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-delays-digital-ruble-cbdc-launch-extends-pilot-phase-indefinitely/) an indefinite delay in the launch of the digital ruble. She attributed the setback to the need for further refinements to ensure that the currency benefits all stakeholders.\n\nHowever, a recent survey indicates that the digital ruble launch was postponed due to the inadequate IT infrastructure of banks that were expected to handle the project.\n\nThe survey of Russian banking experts revealed that 30% of financial institutions are not yet prepared to support the digital ruble. Experts explained that implementing the CBDC requires banks to upgrade their IT systems to handle increased transaction volumes.\n\nMeanwhile, 20% of banking IT specialists stated that their systems are fully equipped for the digital ruble. Another 50% said they are partially prepared but need further upgrades.\n\nAt the same time, around 14% of the respondents expressed concerns over potential information security risks associated with the currency.\n\nGiven these challenges, Russia’s national digital asset initiative could face further obstacles unless major financial institutions fully prepare for its adoption.\n\n###### Mentioned in this article\n\n[![Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2020/imgresize/timthumb.php?src=https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bitcoin-logo.jpg&w=32&h=32&q=75)Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/) [![Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2020/imgresize/timthumb.php?src=https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ethereum-logo-2022.jpg&w=32&h=32&q=75)Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/) [![Tether](https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2020/imgresize/timthumb.php?src=https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tether-logo.jpg&w=32&h=32&q=75)Tether](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/) [![Tether Limited](https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/themes/cryptoslate-2020/imgresize/timthumb.php?src=https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Tether-EURt-logo.png&w=32&h=32&q=75)Tether Limited](https://cryptoslate.com/companies/tether/)\n\n[![XRP Turbo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201280%20453%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://link.cryptoslate.com/xrpturbo)\n\nPosted In: [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/news/bitcoin/), [China](https://cryptoslate.com/places/china/), [India](https://cryptoslate.com/places/india/), [Russia](https://cryptoslate.com/places/russia/), [Adoption](https://cryptoslate.com/adoption/), [Crypto](https://cryptoslate.com/crypto/), [Featured](https://cryptoslate.com/featured-news/)\n\nPeople were interested in these podcasts\n\n[Discover more podcasts →](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-oil-firms-using-bitcoin-and-ethereum-for-cross-border-payments-with-china/#)\n\nPlay Episode\n\n37min\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nJoe Consorti on Bitcoin's role in global macroeconomics\n\nBitcoin and Macro analyst Joe Consorti joins to dig into how US macro data is impacting Bitcoin and the latest on the Bitcoin reserve.Credits\n\nThanks to Liam 'Akiba' Wright for hosting and producing the episodes.\n\n\n\nConnect with CryptoSlate:\n\n\\- X\n\\- Substack\n\\- Google News\n\\- Telegram\n\\- Instagram\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nPhillip Alexeev on CrossFi: The bridge between crypto and traditional banking\n\nIn a recent episode of SlateCast, Phillip Alexeev, Chief Growth Officer at CrossFi, joined CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill to discuss the platform's innovative solutions to integrate crypto with traditional finance. CrossFi’s mission is to provide seamless financial inclusivity through a robust ecosystem that supports non-custodial crypto transactions, partnerships with banks, and scalable blockchain technology.Alexeev described CrossFi as “the Apple Pay for crypto,” emphasizing its role as a bridge between decentralized finance (DeFi) and mainstream banking.“Our focus has always been empowering users by removing gatekeepers while providing access to advanced financial tools,” he said.Non-Custodial Payments RedefinedAt its core, CrossFi offers a unique payment technology enabling users to transact directly from their Web3 wallets at any point-of-sale terminal worldwide. This approach eliminates the need for custodial platforms, maintaining users’ control over their funds. Alexeev highlighted the platform's ability to “connect any Web3 wallet to the CrossFi app,” facilitating crypto-to-fiat transactions seamlessly and securely.Unlike traditional crypto cards, CrossFi partners directly with banks to interact with smart contracts, bypassing third-party intermediaries.“We’ve designed an ecosystem with fewer points of failure while forcing banks to innovate and adopt crypto technology,” Alexeev explained.Why Build a New Layer-1 Blockchain?Addressing the decision to build a proprietary layer-1 blockchain, Alexeev acknowledged the challenges of integrating blockchain with existing banking infrastructure.“No existing blockchain met the security, scalability, and compatibility requirements of traditional banks,” he stated.The customized blockchain allows CrossFi to support seamless interaction between decentralized technologies and institutional frameworks.Flat Fees for TransparencyCrossFi aims to disrupt conventional payment systems\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nBuilding the decentralized data layer with Powerloom’s Swaroop Hegde\n\nSwaroop Hegde, CEO and Co-Founder of Powerloom, joined CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief, Liam “Akiba” Wright, and CEO Nate Whitehill on The SlateCast to discuss the future of decentralized data layers. Backed by notable names like Blockchain Capital and Filecoin, Powerloom is setting a new standard for composable and decentralized data solutions, reshaping how users interact with on-chain data and fostering innovation across web3 applications.The Challenge of Reliable On-Chain DataSwaroop began by highlighting the current inefficiencies in accessing and verifying on-chain data. Traditional methods rely heavily on centralized sources, such as CoinMarketCap or specific blockchain dashboards, leading to potential data manipulation and outdated information.“Most of the usage when it goes outside of the dApp is actually coming from some sort of centralized indexer,”Swaroop noted, emphasizing the vulnerabilities inherent in such a setup.Powerloom addresses these issues with a decentralized node network, enabling real-time data computation without the need for a centralized intermediary.“With over 5,300 nodes, even non-technical users can contribute to the network, ensuring verifiability and reliability,” he explained.Powerloom’s Unique Approach to Data CompositionUnlike traditional indexers, Powerloom operates on a demand-driven system that aggregates data atomically. Swaroop explained,“We don’t sit and index all the data. Instead, we focus on composing data dynamically based on demand.”This approach allows Powerloom to cater to a variety of use cases, from trading data to lending rates across multiple chains.The platform’s composability extends beyond Uniswap and Aave, creating “data markets” that empower users to craft personalized queries and insights. These markets are decentralized and verifiable, ensuring users can trust the integrity of their data.Introducing Generative Prediction Markets (GPM)A standout feature discussed was Powerloom’s Generative Prediction Markets\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nGiovanni Santostani explains Bitcoin Models and Power Law's expansion\n\nBitcoin Power Law Theory creator Giovanni Santostani refutes some criticisms of his Bitcoin models and explains how the power law expands within the Bitcoin ecosystem.Credits\n\nThanks to Liam 'Akiba' Wright for hosting and producing the episodes.\n\n\n\nConnect with CryptoSlate:\n\n\\- X\n\\- Substack\n\\- Google News\n\\- Telegram\n\\- Instagram\n\n[Ad](https://cryptoslate.com/partnerships/)\n\n[![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2096%2096%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\\\\n\\\\\nCryptoSlate on Xx.com/cryptoslate\\\\\n\\\\\nGet the latest crypto news and expert insights.

The trader had invested more than 160,234 ETH when the price was around $1,900, but with a liquidation price set at $1,877, the sudden drop forced the position to close. [Data](https://x.com/lookonchain/status/1899741688689463342/photo/1) from Lookonchain revealed that the trader had moved all their Bitcoin holdings into this leveraged ETH trade before the loss.\n\nThe liquidation happened during a period of heightened market instability, partly driven by global trade tensions. The European Union’s recent retaliatory tariffs have caused uncertainty, affecting both crypto and traditional financial markets. Ether, in particular, has been in a steep decline since Dec. 16, 2024, when it peaked above $4,100. It has since lost over 53% of its value. Analysts from Bitfinex attributed the drop to macroeconomic concerns and the Ethereum network’s high transaction fees discouraging new projects. “A lack of new projects or builders moving to ETH, primarily due to high operating fees, is likely the principal reason behind the lackluster performance of ETH,” the analysts [said](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ether-1-8k-correction-global-tariff-fears-eth-etf-outflows).\n\nThe broader crypto market has also been affected, with Bitcoin and other assets experiencing a sell-off. Many traders are hesitant due to fears about the economic impact of ongoing trade disputes. While ETH’s decline is partially due to external factors, internal network issues have also played a role. The Ethereum network has seen reduced developer activity, which has weakened investor confidence.\n\nAdding to the downward pressure, U.S. spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have struggled, recording net negative outflows for four consecutive weeks. [Data](https://sosovalue.com/assets/etf/Total_Crypto_ETH_ETF_Fund_Flow?page=usETH) from Sosovalue shows that investors pulled more than $119 million from these ETFs last week alone. The lack of inflows limits ETH’s chances of a price rebound, further straining the market.\n\nThe incident has once again highlighted the risks of leveraged trading. While borrowing funds can amplify potential gains, it also increases exposure to severe losses. Even small price fluctuations can trigger large liquidations, as seen in this case. Market analysts believe ETH’s next key level to watch is $1,800, which could serve as a strong support or another breaking point.\n\nWith global economic uncertainty continuing and crypto markets already under pressure, traders are approaching investments cautiously. Whether ETH stabilizes or continues its decline will depend on both macroeconomic trends and internal developments within the Ethereum network. For now, the market remains unpredictable, and leveraged positions continue to carry significant risks.\n\nView Comments\n\n[Terms](https://guce.yahoo.com/terms?locale=en-US) and [Privacy Policy](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-policy?locale=en-US)\n\n[Your Privacy Choices ![](https://s.yimg.com/dv/static/siteApp/img/privacy-choice-control.png)](https://guce.yahoo.com/state-controls?locale=en-US&state=CA)\n\n[CA Privacy Notice](https://guce.yahoo.com/ca-notice?locale=en-US)\n\n[More Info](https://finance.yahoo.com/more-info)\n\n* * *\n\nWaiting for permission\n\nAllow microphone access to enable voice search\n\nTry again.\n\nTry saying",

Binance’s billionaire founder, Changpeng Zhao, who served four months in prison after pleading guilty to violating anti-money-laundering requirements, has been pushing for the Trump administration to grant him a pardon, sources added.\n\nFollowing the report, Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance and its ex-CEO, [stated in a post to X:](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4089128&headline=$BTC;MSTR;COIN;MARA;RIOT;BTBT;BITF;WULF;GREE;SDIG;CORZ;$ECON;SPY;SPX-Changpeng-Zhao-says-WSJ-article-got-the-facts-wrong-about-Binance&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=COIN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) “Sorry to disappoint. The WSJ article got the facts wrong. More than 20 people have told me they were asked by the WSJ (and another media), ‘Can you confirm that CZ made some deal for a pardon?’ They probably asked hundreds of people to have 20 people reach out to me. In essence, they tried hard to make a story to report. Fact: I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with … well, anyone. No felon would mind a pardon, especially being the only one in US history who was ever sentenced to prison for a single BSA charge. Feels like the article is motivated as an attack on the President and crypto, and the residual forces of the ‘war on crypto’ from the last administration are still at work. I am always happy to make crypto great everywhere, US and the rest of the world. It’s good to see that even WSJ thinks I should be pardoned.”\n\n**COINBASE SECURES REGISTRATION IN INDIA:** Coinbase [(COIN)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=COIN&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) announced Tuesday it [has registered with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4087848&headline=COIN-Coinbase-secures-registration-in-India&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=COIN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), which marks a significant milestone in its international expansion strategy. The company plans to launch its initial retail services later this year, followed by additional investment and products in India thereafter. “We’re committed to building in markets that believe in the potential of crypto and onchain innovation,” said John O’Loghlen, Regional Managing Director for APAC at Coinbase. “India represents one of the most exciting market opportunities in the world today, and we’re proud to deepen our investment here in full compliance with local regulations.”\n\nStory Continues\n\nAdditionally on Tuesday, Mizuho lowered the firm’s price target on Coinbase [to $217 from $280 and kept a Neutral rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4087037&headline=COIN-Mizuho-cuts-Coinbase-target-calls--pullback-overdone&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=COIN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares. The firm said that since its last model update on February 20, the price of [bitcoin](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) has fallen from $98,000 to $79,000 and Coinbase shares are down 30%. While some multiple compression is warranted due to lower multiples across technology, the move in Coinbase shares is overdone, the analyst said. Mizuho believes the stock should trade closer to $217. While it sees some upside from here, it remains Neutral given the longer-term risk of pricing pressure from increased competition across the crypto trading space. Mizuho cited lower market multiples for the target cut.\n\n**BIT DIGITAL REPORTS FY24 RESULTS:** On Friday, Bit Digital [(BTBT)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=BTBT&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) reported FY24 [earnings per share of 19c on revenue of $108.1M,](https://bit-digital.com/press-releases/bit-digital-inc-announces-fiscal-year-2024-financial-results/?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) which compared to a loss per share of (16c) on revenue of $44.9M last year. The company earned 949.9 bitcoins during 2024, a 37% decrease from the prior year, and treasury holdings of BTC and ETH were 741.9 and 27,623.2, respectively, with a fair market value of approximately $69.3M and $92.1M on December 31, respectively.\n\nThe company said, “2024 marked a pivotal shift for Bit Digital. Our business was historically driven by digital asset mining, but the successful launch and rapid expansion of our HPC business fundamentally reshaped our company. This evolution drove over 140% revenue growth, with these new business lines contributing nearly half of total revenue. A defining milestone in this transformation was our acquisition of Enovum Data Centers in October. More than just an infrastructure expansion, Enovum provided us with a proven team, operational expertise, and a scalable platform to develop and operate data centers. It also introduced colocation services as a new business line, further diversifying our revenue streams and strengthening our [AI](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) compute capabilities. Bitcoin mining remained a key revenue contributor, generating $58.6M, a 32% increase year-over-year. However, as our HPC business scaled, mining’s share of total revenue declined to 54% in 2024, and further to 40% in Q424, compared to 98% in 2023. This shift underscores our strategic pivot toward infrastructure-driven revenue streams while maintaining disciplined mining operations.”\n\n**ANALYSTS UPDATES BITCOIN MINER MODELS:** On Thursday, JPMorgan downgraded Cipher Mining [(](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=CIFR&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) CIFR) to [Neutral from Overweight without a price target.](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088576&headline=CIFR-Cipher-Mining-just-downgraded-at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=CIFR&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) The firm updated bitcoin miner price targets and models to reflect the Q4 results and changes in bitcoin price and the network hash rate. The firm now sees less upside potential relative to peers for Cipher Mining shares. Cipher could sign a high performance compute deal at its Barber Lake site, which could drive upside, but deals can take up to nine months to negotiate and finalize, the analyst said.\n\nJPMorgan also lowered the firm’s price target on Mara Holdings [(MARA)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=MARA&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [$18 from $23 and kept a Neutral rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088580&headline=MARA-Mara-Holdings-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=MARA&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares as well as on CleanSpark [(](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=CLSK&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) CLSK) to [$12 from $17 and kept an Overweight rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088579&headline=CLSK-CleanSpark-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=CLSK&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares and on Riot Platforms [(RIOT)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=RIOT&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [$13 from $16 and kept an Overweight rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088581&headline=RIOT-Riot-Platforms-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=RIOT&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares.\n\nAdditionally, the firm upgraded IREN [(IREN)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=IREN&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $12, down from $15](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088578&headline=IREN-IREN-just-upgraded-at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=IREN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral). JPMorgan named IREN its top pick citing the company’s “strong” mining operations and high performance computing “optionality.” The shares have “been overly punished” year-to-date, and offer 70% upside at current levels, which could prove conservative if IREN announces an HPC deal with a name-brand tenant, the analyst said.\n\n**HIVE PRICE TARGET LOWERED:** Cantor Fitzgerald lowered the firm’s price target on [Hive](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hive?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) Digital [(HIVE)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=HIVE&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on Tuesday [to $8 from $11 and kept an Overweight rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4087369&headline=HIVE-Hive-Digital-price-target-lowered-by--at-Cantor-Fitzgerald-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=HIVE&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares. Hive said it mined 89 bitcoin during the month of February, or 3.1 bitcoin per day, a decrease from 102 bitcoin mined in January, and its share of the overall bitcoin network decreased to 0.69% from 0.73% on a peak hash rate basis, the analyst said. Cantor continues to believe that current levels represent an attractive risk/reward, as the firm is confident in Hive’s ability to execute on its bitcoin mining and AI Cloud targets, which will represent 300% hash rate growth and $100M in annualized run-rate revenue in 2025, respectively.\n\n**CRYPTO STOCK PLAYS:** Publicly traded companies in the space include Bit Digital, Coinbase, Core Scientific [(CORZ)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=CORZ&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), Greenidge Generation [(GREE)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=GREE&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), Mara Holdings, Strategy [(MSTR)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=MSTR&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), Riot Platforms, Stronghold Digital Mining [(SDIG)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=SDIG&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) and TeraWulf [(WULF)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=WULF&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral).\n\n**PRICE ACTION:** As of time of writing, bitcoin dropped about 6% this week to $83,160 in U.S. dollars, according to CoinDesk.\n\n_Published first on [TheFly](https://thefly.com/?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

Binance’s billionaire founder, Changpeng Zhao, who served four months in prison after pleading guilty to violating anti-money-laundering requirements, has been pushing for the Trump administration to grant him a pardon, sources added.\n\nFollowing the report, Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance and its ex-CEO, [stated in a post to X:](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4089128&headline=$BTC;MSTR;COIN;MARA;RIOT;BTBT;BITF;WULF;GREE;SDIG;CORZ;$ECON;SPY;SPX-Changpeng-Zhao-says-WSJ-article-got-the-facts-wrong-about-Binance&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=COIN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) “Sorry to disappoint. The WSJ article got the facts wrong. More than 20 people have told me they were asked by the WSJ (and another media), ‘Can you confirm that CZ made some deal for a pardon?’ They probably asked hundreds of people to have 20 people reach out to me. In essence, they tried hard to make a story to report. Fact: I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with … well, anyone. No felon would mind a pardon, especially being the only one in US history who was ever sentenced to prison for a single BSA charge. Feels like the article is motivated as an attack on the President and crypto, and the residual forces of the ‘war on crypto’ from the last administration are still at work. I am always happy to make crypto great everywhere, US and the rest of the world. It’s good to see that even WSJ thinks I should be pardoned.”\n\n**COINBASE SECURES REGISTRATION IN INDIA:** Coinbase [(COIN)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=COIN&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) announced Tuesday it [has registered with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4087848&headline=COIN-Coinbase-secures-registration-in-India&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=COIN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), which marks a significant milestone in its international expansion strategy. The company plans to launch its initial retail services later this year, followed by additional investment and products in India thereafter. “We’re committed to building in markets that believe in the potential of crypto and onchain innovation,” said John O’Loghlen, Regional Managing Director for APAC at Coinbase. “India represents one of the most exciting market opportunities in the world today, and we’re proud to deepen our investment here in full compliance with local regulations.”\n\nStory Continues\n\nAdditionally on Tuesday, Mizuho lowered the firm’s price target on Coinbase [to $217 from $280 and kept a Neutral rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4087037&headline=COIN-Mizuho-cuts-Coinbase-target-calls--pullback-overdone&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=COIN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares. The firm said that since its last model update on February 20, the price of [bitcoin](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) has fallen from $98,000 to $79,000 and Coinbase shares are down 30%. While some multiple compression is warranted due to lower multiples across technology, the move in Coinbase shares is overdone, the analyst said. Mizuho believes the stock should trade closer to $217. While it sees some upside from here, it remains Neutral given the longer-term risk of pricing pressure from increased competition across the crypto trading space. Mizuho cited lower market multiples for the target cut.\n\n**BIT DIGITAL REPORTS FY24 RESULTS:** On Friday, Bit Digital [(BTBT)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=BTBT&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) reported FY24 [earnings per share of 19c on revenue of $108.1M,](https://bit-digital.com/press-releases/bit-digital-inc-announces-fiscal-year-2024-financial-results/?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) which compared to a loss per share of (16c) on revenue of $44.9M last year. The company earned 949.9 bitcoins during 2024, a 37% decrease from the prior year, and treasury holdings of BTC and ETH were 741.9 and 27,623.2, respectively, with a fair market value of approximately $69.3M and $92.1M on December 31, respectively.\n\nThe company said, “2024 marked a pivotal shift for Bit Digital. Our business was historically driven by digital asset mining, but the successful launch and rapid expansion of our HPC business fundamentally reshaped our company. This evolution drove over 140% revenue growth, with these new business lines contributing nearly half of total revenue. A defining milestone in this transformation was our acquisition of Enovum Data Centers in October. More than just an infrastructure expansion, Enovum provided us with a proven team, operational expertise, and a scalable platform to develop and operate data centers. It also introduced colocation services as a new business line, further diversifying our revenue streams and strengthening our [AI](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) compute capabilities. Bitcoin mining remained a key revenue contributor, generating $58.6M, a 32% increase year-over-year. However, as our HPC business scaled, mining’s share of total revenue declined to 54% in 2024, and further to 40% in Q424, compared to 98% in 2023. This shift underscores our strategic pivot toward infrastructure-driven revenue streams while maintaining disciplined mining operations.”\n\n**ANALYSTS UPDATES BITCOIN MINER MODELS:** On Thursday, JPMorgan downgraded Cipher Mining [(](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=CIFR&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) CIFR) to [Neutral from Overweight without a price target.](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088576&headline=CIFR-Cipher-Mining-just-downgraded-at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=CIFR&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) The firm updated bitcoin miner price targets and models to reflect the Q4 results and changes in bitcoin price and the network hash rate. The firm now sees less upside potential relative to peers for Cipher Mining shares. Cipher could sign a high performance compute deal at its Barber Lake site, which could drive upside, but deals can take up to nine months to negotiate and finalize, the analyst said.\n\nJPMorgan also lowered the firm’s price target on Mara Holdings [(MARA)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=MARA&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [$18 from $23 and kept a Neutral rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088580&headline=MARA-Mara-Holdings-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=MARA&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares as well as on CleanSpark [(](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=CLSK&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) CLSK) to [$12 from $17 and kept an Overweight rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088579&headline=CLSK-CleanSpark-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=CLSK&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares and on Riot Platforms [(RIOT)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=RIOT&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [$13 from $16 and kept an Overweight rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088581&headline=RIOT-Riot-Platforms-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=RIOT&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares.\n\nAdditionally, the firm upgraded IREN [(IREN)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=IREN&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $12, down from $15](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088578&headline=IREN-IREN-just-upgraded-at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=IREN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral).

The company earned 949.9 bitcoins during 2024, a 37% decrease from the prior year, and treasury holdings of BTC and ETH were 741.9 and 27,623.2, respectively, with a fair market value of approximately $69.3M and $92.1M on December 31, respectively.\n\nThe company said, “2024 marked a pivotal shift for Bit Digital. Our business was historically driven by digital asset mining, but the successful launch and rapid expansion of our HPC business fundamentally reshaped our company. This evolution drove over 140% revenue growth, with these new business lines contributing nearly half of total revenue. A defining milestone in this transformation was our acquisition of Enovum Data Centers in October. More than just an infrastructure expansion, Enovum provided us with a proven team, operational expertise, and a scalable platform to develop and operate data centers. It also introduced colocation services as a new business line, further diversifying our revenue streams and strengthening our [AI](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) compute capabilities. Bitcoin mining remained a key revenue contributor, generating $58.6M, a 32% increase year-over-year. However, as our HPC business scaled, mining’s share of total revenue declined to 54% in 2024, and further to 40% in Q424, compared to 98% in 2023. This shift underscores our strategic pivot toward infrastructure-driven revenue streams while maintaining disciplined mining operations.”\n\n**ANALYSTS UPDATES BITCOIN MINER MODELS:** On Thursday, JPMorgan downgraded Cipher Mining [(](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=CIFR&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) CIFR) to [Neutral from Overweight without a price target.](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088576&headline=CIFR-Cipher-Mining-just-downgraded-at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=CIFR&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) The firm updated bitcoin miner price targets and models to reflect the Q4 results and changes in bitcoin price and the network hash rate. The firm now sees less upside potential relative to peers for Cipher Mining shares. Cipher could sign a high performance compute deal at its Barber Lake site, which could drive upside, but deals can take up to nine months to negotiate and finalize, the analyst said.\n\nJPMorgan also lowered the firm’s price target on Mara Holdings [(MARA)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=MARA&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [$18 from $23 and kept a Neutral rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088580&headline=MARA-Mara-Holdings-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=MARA&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares as well as on CleanSpark [(](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=CLSK&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) CLSK) to [$12 from $17 and kept an Overweight rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088579&headline=CLSK-CleanSpark-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=CLSK&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares and on Riot Platforms [(RIOT)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=RIOT&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [$13 from $16 and kept an Overweight rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088581&headline=RIOT-Riot-Platforms-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=RIOT&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares.\n\nAdditionally, the firm upgraded IREN [(IREN)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=IREN&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $12, down from $15](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088578&headline=IREN-IREN-just-upgraded-at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=IREN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral). JPMorgan named IREN its top pick citing the company’s “strong” mining operations and high performance computing “optionality.” The shares have “been overly punished” year-to-date, and offer 70% upside at current levels, which could prove conservative if IREN announces an HPC deal with a name-brand tenant, the analyst said.\n\n**HIVE PRICE TARGET LOWERED:** Cantor Fitzgerald lowered the firm’s price target on [Hive](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hive?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) Digital [(HIVE)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=HIVE&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on Tuesday [to $8 from $11 and kept an Overweight rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4087369&headline=HIVE-Hive-Digital-price-target-lowered-by--at-Cantor-Fitzgerald-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=HIVE&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares. Hive said it mined 89 bitcoin during the month of February, or 3.1 bitcoin per day, a decrease from 102 bitcoin mined in January, and its share of the overall bitcoin network decreased to 0.69% from 0.73% on a peak hash rate basis, the analyst said. Cantor continues to believe that current levels represent an attractive risk/reward, as the firm is confident in Hive’s ability to execute on its bitcoin mining and AI Cloud targets, which will represent 300% hash rate growth and $100M in annualized run-rate revenue in 2025, respectively.\n\n**CRYPTO STOCK PLAYS:** Publicly traded companies in the space include Bit Digital, Coinbase, Core Scientific [(CORZ)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=CORZ&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), Greenidge Generation [(GREE)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=GREE&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), Mara Holdings, Strategy [(MSTR)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=MSTR&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), Riot Platforms, Stronghold Digital Mining [(SDIG)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=SDIG&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) and TeraWulf [(WULF)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=WULF&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral).\n\n**PRICE ACTION:** As of time of writing, bitcoin dropped about 6% this week to $83,160 in U.S. dollars, according to CoinDesk.\n\n_Published first on [TheFly](https://thefly.com/?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

While this might signal an incoming crypto rally, do not ignore the market's inherent volatility and risks associated with hype-driven investments. Moreover, regulatory ambiguity around this asset class is another reason you should be careful while investing in this asset.\n\n![Should I invest in Bitcoin?](https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-119044145,width-300,height-225,imgsize-159732,resizemode-75/should-i-invest-in-bitcoin.jpg)Getty ImagesBefore investing in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, make sure to check the authenticity of the application you are using. Also, do not invest in coins that are merely driven by hype, and have no actual, real-world value.\n\nWith bears champing at the bit and dragging down the overall market sentiment, an unlikely spike has managed to lift a section of Indian investors. The recent announcement by US President [Donald Trump](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/panache/panache-people-101/donald-trump/profileshow/79057526.cms) to create a “strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital assets stockpile” has sent the [crypto](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency) enthusiasts in India into a tizzy. Hoping to cash in on what they believe could be the next big rally, they have led a surge in trading volumes, with CoinDCX reporting a 36% hike and Mudrex registering a 30% spike.\n\nIncome Tax Guide\n\n[Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/income-tax-slabs) [Income Tax Calculator 2025](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/calculators/income-tax-calculator) [New Income Tax Bill 2025](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/new-income-tax-bill-2025)\n\nWhile the reserve will only include Bitcoin, already owned by the US government, not acquired or actively bought, the digital asset stockpile will consist of tokens other than the Bitcoin—Ethereum (ETH), [Solana](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/solana) (SOL), [Ripple](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ripple) ( [XRP](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/xrp)), and [Cardano](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/cardano) (ADA), which will also not be acquired. The announcement is significant because it’s the first time that Bitcoin has been recognised as a reserve asset of the US government.\n\n“This sends a powerful message to the world about how blockchain and digital assets are becoming mainstream,” says Sumit Gupta, co-founder of CoinDCX. Agrees Edul Patel, Co-founder of Mudrex: “There is a strong future for crypto and Bitcoin globally, not just in the US.”\n\n## Chase hype, pay the price\n\nCryptocurrency is a sentiment-driven market, and its volatile nature is no secret. In fact, Trump’s earlier promise of such a reserve and ease of regulation had seen the token surge to an all-time high of $109,071.8 in January.\n\nWhile his recent announcement has again fuelled the sentiments, over the years, such bold statements have been used by influential names to sway the market. This event may not be any different. If such a reserve and stockpile are built, there could be a sharp rise in the prices of select coins, with the possibility of market manipulation as well. If big players can move prices with a single announcement or policy shift, it raises serious concerns about fair play.\n\n![ET logo](https://img.etimg.com/photo/118783427.cms)\n\n### Live Events\n\nWithout strict supervision, those with insider knowledge could take advantage of these swings to cash in, while retail investors are likely to be caught off guard. For investors, this means additional risk and [volatility](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/volatility) because they could end up buying at inflated prices and suffer losses when the hype dies down and prices settle.\n\nTake the meme coin craze and the metaverse hype in 2021. Tech billionaire and a part of Trump’s team, Elon Musk, openly backed Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, triggering a massive bull run in both coins. Around the same time, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s talk about the metaverse sent coins like Decentraland’s MANA soaring. However, these fizzled out as quickly as they had shot up. Many investors who jumped in due to the fear of missing out incurred massive losses.\n\nAnish Bhilwara was one such investor. The 24-year-old entrepreneur invested all his savings worth Rs. 60,000 in Shiba Inu, Doge, Ripple, BitTorrent and Polymesh in 2021, giving in to the hype of meme coins. “I just wanted to prove myself to my family,” says Bhilwara, who ended up losing 85% of his investment. Hoping to recover his losses over time, Bhilwara stayed invested but lost again when [WazirX](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/wazirx) was hacked.\n\nThese are regular occurrences in the world of cryptocurrency, especially those who invest in hype-driven alt coins. Sunil Mahajan (name changed) faced a similar fate. The 45-year-old IT professional saw initial success by investing in Bitcoin, [Ethereum](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ethereum), and XRP. “These were long-term bets, and they worked well for me,” he says.\n\nWhen his friends started pouring money into meme coins, FOMO kicked in. Mahajan invested Rs.20 lakh across various coins. Today, they’re worth Rs.10 lakh. “I invested through WazirX, but now they are going to pay only 60% of the remaining amount (ET Wealth could not independently verify this claim) because it got hacked. I am never investing in crypto again,” says Mahajan, who invested to buy a Mercedes. “Now I can’t even buy a decent car,” he says wryly. Mahajan believes his mistake wasn’t in choosing Bitcoin or ETH, but in letting emotions drive his bets.\n\nThis is the reason the Indian government has consistently discouraged crypto investments. The RBI had banned trading in crypto in 2018, but the Supreme Court lifted it in 2020. Despite this, the government has tried to ward off enthusiastic investors by taxing crypto gains at 30% and not allowing losses from crypto trading to be set off against profits from other trading.\n\nThe 2025 budget has tightened the screws further. “Virtual digital assets, including cryptocurrencies and NFTs, are now categorised under undisclosed income, subjecting these to higher tax rates,” says Akshat Pande, Managing Partner, Alpha Partners.\n\n**Bitcoin volatility over the years**\n\nThe high volatility posed a risk for investors.\n\n![im1-](https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-119016637/im1-.jpg)\n\n## What should you do?\n\nIn line with most experts’ opinion, ET Wealth doesn’t recommend investing in cryptos since it remains a high-risk option, and the US creating a reserve could add more uncertainty. “Crypto may not be a good investment idea unless there’s clarity on its overall regulatory acceptance,” cautions Rohit Shah, Founder and CEO, GYR Financial Planners. Until the regulatory landscape is clearer, investors would be better off restraining from cryptos.\n\nIf, however, you wish to experiment or are curious, stick to blue-chip coins. Though these, too, are volatile, they are cyclical in nature. If you end up losing money, you may earn it back if you stay invested for a long time. Other coins are sentiment-driven and more like a gamble. The top five blue-chip coins include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Solana, and Ripple. However, be careful of the amount you invest. No more than 2-5% of your portfolio should be allocated to crypto currency. Or only as much as you can afford to see go up in smoke.\n\n## Before you invest in crypto...\n\n_To minimise your losses, consider these tips while investing._\n\n_**Invest via fiu-ind platform**_\n\n_The registration with Financial Intelligence Unit, India, shows the exchange’s commitment to following the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) guidelines.

While this might signal an incoming crypto rally, do not ignore the market's inherent volatility and risks associated with hype-driven investments. Moreover, regulatory ambiguity around this asset class is another reason you should be careful while investing in this asset.\n\n![Should I invest in Bitcoin?](https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-119044145,width-300,height-225,imgsize-159732,resizemode-75/should-i-invest-in-bitcoin.jpg)Getty ImagesBefore investing in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, make sure to check the authenticity of the application you are using. Also, do not invest in coins that are merely driven by hype, and have no actual, real-world value.\n\nWith bears champing at the bit and dragging down the overall market sentiment, an unlikely spike has managed to lift a section of Indian investors. The recent announcement by US President [Donald Trump](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/panache/panache-people-101/donald-trump/profileshow/79057526.cms) to create a “strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital assets stockpile” has sent the [crypto](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency) enthusiasts in India into a tizzy. Hoping to cash in on what they believe could be the next big rally, they have led a surge in trading volumes, with CoinDCX reporting a 36% hike and Mudrex registering a 30% spike.\n\nIncome Tax Guide\n\n[Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/income-tax-slabs) [Income Tax Calculator 2025](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/calculators/income-tax-calculator) [New Income Tax Bill 2025](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/new-income-tax-bill-2025)\n\nWhile the reserve will only include Bitcoin, already owned by the US government, not acquired or actively bought, the digital asset stockpile will consist of tokens other than the Bitcoin—Ethereum (ETH), [Solana](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/solana) (SOL), [Ripple](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ripple) ( [XRP](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/xrp)), and [Cardano](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/cardano) (ADA), which will also not be acquired. The announcement is significant because it’s the first time that Bitcoin has been recognised as a reserve asset of the US government.\n\n“This sends a powerful message to the world about how blockchain and digital assets are becoming mainstream,” says Sumit Gupta, co-founder of CoinDCX. Agrees Edul Patel, Co-founder of Mudrex: “There is a strong future for crypto and Bitcoin globally, not just in the US.”\n\n## Chase hype, pay the price\n\nCryptocurrency is a sentiment-driven market, and its volatile nature is no secret. In fact, Trump’s earlier promise of such a reserve and ease of regulation had seen the token surge to an all-time high of $109,071.8 in January.\n\nWhile his recent announcement has again fuelled the sentiments, over the years, such bold statements have been used by influential names to sway the market. This event may not be any different. If such a reserve and stockpile are built, there could be a sharp rise in the prices of select coins, with the possibility of market manipulation as well. If big players can move prices with a single announcement or policy shift, it raises serious concerns about fair play.\n\n![ET logo](https://img.etimg.com/photo/118783427.cms)\n\n### Live Events\n\nWithout strict supervision, those with insider knowledge could take advantage of these swings to cash in, while retail investors are likely to be caught off guard. For investors, this means additional risk and [volatility](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/volatility) because they could end up buying at inflated prices and suffer losses when the hype dies down and prices settle.\n\nTake the meme coin craze and the metaverse hype in 2021. Tech billionaire and a part of Trump’s team, Elon Musk, openly backed Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, triggering a massive bull run in both coins. Around the same time, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s talk about the metaverse sent coins like Decentraland’s MANA soaring. However, these fizzled out as quickly as they had shot up. Many investors who jumped in due to the fear of missing out incurred massive losses.\n\nAnish Bhilwara was one such investor. The 24-year-old entrepreneur invested all his savings worth Rs. 60,000 in Shiba Inu, Doge, Ripple, BitTorrent and Polymesh in 2021, giving in to the hype of meme coins. “I just wanted to prove myself to my family,” says Bhilwara, who ended up losing 85% of his investment. Hoping to recover his losses over time, Bhilwara stayed invested but lost again when [WazirX](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/wazirx) was hacked.\n\nThese are regular occurrences in the world of cryptocurrency, especially those who invest in hype-driven alt coins. Sunil Mahajan (name changed) faced a similar fate. The 45-year-old IT professional saw initial success by investing in Bitcoin, [Ethereum](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ethereum), and XRP. “These were long-term bets, and they worked well for me,” he says.\n\nWhen his friends started pouring money into meme coins, FOMO kicked in. Mahajan invested Rs.20 lakh across various coins. Today, they’re worth Rs.10 lakh. “I invested through WazirX, but now they are going to pay only 60% of the remaining amount (ET Wealth could not independently verify this claim) because it got hacked. I am never investing in crypto again,” says Mahajan, who invested to buy a Mercedes. “Now I can’t even buy a decent car,” he says wryly. Mahajan believes his mistake wasn’t in choosing Bitcoin or ETH, but in letting emotions drive his bets.\n\nThis is the reason the Indian government has consistently discouraged crypto investments. The RBI had banned trading in crypto in 2018, but the Supreme Court lifted it in 2020. Despite this, the government has tried to ward off enthusiastic investors by taxing crypto gains at 30% and not allowing losses from crypto trading to be set off against profits from other trading.\n\nThe 2025 budget has tightened the screws further. “Virtual digital assets, including cryptocurrencies and NFTs, are now categorised under undisclosed income, subjecting these to higher tax rates,” says Akshat Pande, Managing Partner, Alpha Partners.\n\n**Bitcoin volatility over the years**\n\nThe high volatility posed a risk for investors.\n\n![im1-](https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-119016637/im1-.jpg)\n\n## What should you do?\n\nIn line with most experts’ opinion, ET Wealth doesn’t recommend investing in cryptos since it remains a high-risk option, and the US creating a reserve could add more uncertainty. “Crypto may not be a good investment idea unless there’s clarity on its overall regulatory acceptance,” cautions Rohit Shah, Founder and CEO, GYR Financial Planners. Until the regulatory landscape is clearer, investors would be better off restraining from cryptos.\n\nIf, however, you wish to experiment or are curious, stick to blue-chip coins. Though these, too, are volatile, they are cyclical in nature. If you end up losing money, you may earn it back if you stay invested for a long time. Other coins are sentiment-driven and more like a gamble. The top five blue-chip coins include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Solana, and Ripple. However, be careful of the amount you invest. No more than 2-5% of your portfolio should be allocated to crypto currency. Or only as much as you can afford to see go up in smoke.\n\n## Before you invest in crypto...\n\n_To minimise your losses, consider these tips while investing._\n\n_**Invest via fiu-ind platform**_\n\n_The registration with Financial Intelligence Unit, India, shows the exchange’s commitment to following the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) guidelines. Opt for compliant platforms to protect your assets._\n\n_**Beware of fake apps, websites**_\n\n_To avoid scams, verify the authenticity of a website or app and check if it is regulated by a reputable authority._\n\n_**Research & understand**_\n\n_Research the underlying technology, use case, and adoption potential of the coin. Do not fall for hype-driven coins that lack real-world utility._\n\n_**Have an investing cap**_\n\n_Avoid taking loans or using emergency funds; invest only the amount you can afford to lose.

While this might signal an incoming crypto rally, do not ignore the market's inherent volatility and risks associated with hype-driven investments. Moreover, regulatory ambiguity around this asset class is another reason you should be careful while investing in this asset.\n\n![Should I invest in Bitcoin?](https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-119044145,width-300,height-225,imgsize-159732,resizemode-75/should-i-invest-in-bitcoin.jpg)Getty ImagesBefore investing in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, make sure to check the authenticity of the application you are using. Also, do not invest in coins that are merely driven by hype, and have no actual, real-world value.\n\nWith bears champing at the bit and dragging down the overall market sentiment, an unlikely spike has managed to lift a section of Indian investors. The recent announcement by US President [Donald Trump](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/panache/panache-people-101/donald-trump/profileshow/79057526.cms) to create a “strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital assets stockpile” has sent the [crypto](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency) enthusiasts in India into a tizzy. Hoping to cash in on what they believe could be the next big rally, they have led a surge in trading volumes, with CoinDCX reporting a 36% hike and Mudrex registering a 30% spike.\n\nIncome Tax Guide\n\n[Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/income-tax-slabs) [Income Tax Calculator 2025](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/calculators/income-tax-calculator) [New Income Tax Bill 2025](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/new-income-tax-bill-2025)\n\nWhile the reserve will only include Bitcoin, already owned by the US government, not acquired or actively bought, the digital asset stockpile will consist of tokens other than the Bitcoin—Ethereum (ETH), [Solana](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/solana) (SOL), [Ripple](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ripple) ( [XRP](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/xrp)), and [Cardano](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/cardano) (ADA), which will also not be acquired. The announcement is significant because it’s the first time that Bitcoin has been recognised as a reserve asset of the US government.\n\n“This sends a powerful message to the world about how blockchain and digital assets are becoming mainstream,” says Sumit Gupta, co-founder of CoinDCX. Agrees Edul Patel, Co-founder of Mudrex: “There is a strong future for crypto and Bitcoin globally, not just in the US.”\n\n## Chase hype, pay the price\n\nCryptocurrency is a sentiment-driven market, and its volatile nature is no secret. In fact, Trump’s earlier promise of such a reserve and ease of regulation had seen the token surge to an all-time high of $109,071.8 in January.\n\nWhile his recent announcement has again fuelled the sentiments, over the years, such bold statements have been used by influential names to sway the market. This event may not be any different. If such a reserve and stockpile are built, there could be a sharp rise in the prices of select coins, with the possibility of market manipulation as well. If big players can move prices with a single announcement or policy shift, it raises serious concerns about fair play.\n\n![ET logo](https://img.etimg.com/photo/118783427.cms)\n\n### Live Events\n\nWithout strict supervision, those with insider knowledge could take advantage of these swings to cash in, while retail investors are likely to be caught off guard. For investors, this means additional risk and [volatility](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/volatility) because they could end up buying at inflated prices and suffer losses when the hype dies down and prices settle.\n\nTake the meme coin craze and the metaverse hype in 2021. Tech billionaire and a part of Trump’s team, Elon Musk, openly backed Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, triggering a massive bull run in both coins. Around the same time, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s talk about the metaverse sent coins like Decentraland’s MANA soaring. However, these fizzled out as quickly as they had shot up. Many investors who jumped in due to the fear of missing out incurred massive losses.\n\nAnish Bhilwara was one such investor. The 24-year-old entrepreneur invested all his savings worth Rs. 60,000 in Shiba Inu, Doge, Ripple, BitTorrent and Polymesh in 2021, giving in to the hype of meme coins. “I just wanted to prove myself to my family,” says Bhilwara, who ended up losing 85% of his investment. Hoping to recover his losses over time, Bhilwara stayed invested but lost again when [WazirX](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/wazirx) was hacked.\n\nThese are regular occurrences in the world of cryptocurrency, especially those who invest in hype-driven alt coins. Sunil Mahajan (name changed) faced a similar fate. The 45-year-old IT professional saw initial success by investing in Bitcoin, [Ethereum](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ethereum), and XRP. “These were long-term bets, and they worked well for me,” he says.\n\nWhen his friends started pouring money into meme coins, FOMO kicked in. Mahajan invested Rs.20 lakh across various coins. Today, they’re worth Rs.10 lakh. “I invested through WazirX, but now they are going to pay only 60% of the remaining amount (ET Wealth could not independently verify this claim) because it got hacked. I am never investing in crypto again,” says Mahajan, who invested to buy a Mercedes. “Now I can’t even buy a decent car,” he says wryly. Mahajan believes his mistake wasn’t in choosing Bitcoin or ETH, but in letting emotions drive his bets.\n\nThis is the reason the Indian government has consistently discouraged crypto investments. The RBI had banned trading in crypto in 2018, but the Supreme Court lifted it in 2020. Despite this, the government has tried to ward off enthusiastic investors by taxing crypto gains at 30% and not allowing losses from crypto trading to be set off against profits from other trading.\n\nThe 2025 budget has tightened the screws further. “Virtual digital assets, including cryptocurrencies and NFTs, are now categorised under undisclosed income, subjecting these to higher tax rates,” says Akshat Pande, Managing Partner, Alpha Partners.\n\n**Bitcoin volatility over the years**\n\nThe high volatility posed a risk for investors.\n\n![im1-](https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-119016637/im1-.jpg)\n\n## What should you do?\n\nIn line with most experts’ opinion, ET Wealth doesn’t recommend investing in cryptos since it remains a high-risk option, and the US creating a reserve could add more uncertainty. “Crypto may not be a good investment idea unless there’s clarity on its overall regulatory acceptance,” cautions Rohit Shah, Founder and CEO, GYR Financial Planners. Until the regulatory landscape is clearer, investors would be better off restraining from cryptos.\n\nIf, however, you wish to experiment or are curious, stick to blue-chip coins. Though these, too, are volatile, they are cyclical in nature. If you end up losing money, you may earn it back if you stay invested for a long time. Other coins are sentiment-driven and more like a gamble. The top five blue-chip coins include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Solana, and Ripple. However, be careful of the amount you invest. No more than 2-5% of your portfolio should be allocated to crypto currency. Or only as much as you can afford to see go up in smoke.\n\n## Before you invest in crypto...\n\n_To minimise your losses, consider these tips while investing._\n\n_**Invest via fiu-ind platform**_\n\n_The registration with Financial Intelligence Unit, India, shows the exchange’s commitment to following the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) guidelines. Opt for compliant platforms to protect your assets._\n\n_**Beware of fake apps, websites**_\n\n_To avoid scams, verify the authenticity of a website or app and check if it is regulated by a reputable authority._\n\n_**Research & understand**_\n\n_Research the underlying technology, use case, and adoption potential of the coin. Do not fall for hype-driven coins that lack real-world utility._\n\n_**Have an investing cap**_\n\n_Avoid taking loans or using emergency funds; invest only the amount you can afford to lose.

With BexBack’s 100% deposit bonus , traders can amplify their profits even further: If the initial deposit is 2 BTC, the bonus doubles it to 4 BTC. Under the same scenario, the profit would increase to 10 BTC, making the return on investment an impressive 1000%. It is important to note that while leverage increases profit potential, it also comes with the risk of liquidation, so risk management is essential. How Does the 100% Deposit Bonus Work? BexBack’s 100% deposit bonus cannot be directly withdrawn but can be used to open larger trading positions and increase profit potential. During times of significant market fluctuations, the bonus can also serve as additional margin , helping reduce the risk of liquidation.
