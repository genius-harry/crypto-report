AB is a public blockchain infrastructure project committed to building a decentralized future. It provides efficient and secure foundational support for DApps and a wide range of digital assets. Its high-performance mainnet and cross-chain capabilities are key to enabling the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). The project currently focuses on practical scenarios including DeFi, IoT, and enterprise services. Originally launched as Newton, AB completed its rebranding in February 2025, marking a strategic shift from early community economy exploration toward a new phase of blockchain infrastructure evolution.

Real-world assets are rapidly becoming a key narrative within the global on-chain ecosystem. In late 2024, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenized U.S. Treasury product, which has since become the largest of its kind by market capitalization. In early 2025, Circle announced the acquisition of RWA platform Hashnote and integrated it with its USDC-linked fund products, further advancing the convergence between stablecoins and real-world financial instruments. These developments reflect the accelerating global interest in on-chain RWAs. According to data from RWA.xyz, as of March 2025, the total value of RWAs locked on-chain has surpassed $18.6 billion, up nearly 20% since the beginning of the year.

The listing of AB represents another strategic step in[  _WEEX_](http://www.weex.com)’s commitment to blockchain infrastructure development.
