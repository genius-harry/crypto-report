Major cryptocurrencies including [Bitcoin](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bitcoin-four-minute-instant-guide-explainer), [Ethereum](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-ethereum-quickly-explained-four-minute-guide), and [Solana](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-solana-a-scalable-decentralized-network-for-dapps) are up—along with U.S. equities—after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday [held interest rates steady](https://decrypt.co/310718/bitcoin-wavers-as-fed-holds-rates-steady) and the central bank's chair gave a calming press conference.

The biggest cryptocurrency had jumped before the Fed's announcement, but is now up even more: [Bitcoin's price](https://decrypt.co/price/bitcoin) now stands at $85,648, a more than 4% rise over the past day. The price rose as high as $85,890, marking the highest level since March 9.

The [price of Ethereum](https://decrypt.co/price/ethereum) is up even more: the second biggest virtual coin is up more than 7% over the same period, with a current price of $2,038.

And Solana is [currently trading hands](https://decrypt.co/price/solana) for nearly $134, climbing by 8% over a 24-hour period; the coin, which is the sixthbiggest digital asset, jumped by 2% in the hour after Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke.

The wider crypto market is now up by more than 3% over the past day, and its total market cap stands at $2.91 trillion.

## [Bitcoin Shrugs as Fed Projects Two Rate Cuts in 2025, Holds Rates Steady](https://decrypt.co/310718/bitcoin-wavers-as-fed-holds-rates-steady)

The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday, prolonging a months-long pause on rate cuts amid economic uncertainty fueled by U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
The price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which rose on Wednesday morning, was roughly flat immediately after the central bank stood pat for a third consecutive time but was still up 4% over the past 24 hours to trade at about $84,500, according to data provider CoinGecko.
The U.S. central bank’s decision was wi...

U.S. stocks surged following Powell's press conference but have cooled off slightly since, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both up by more than 1% on the day.

Equities and crypto had taken a battering earlier this month after President Trump's [unpredictable tariff announcements](https://decrypt.co/304089/trumps-trade-war-rocks-broader-market-futures-bitcoin-sink) left Wall Street second-guessing what the White House would do next. Investors adopted a "risk-off" strategy, leading to a stock market and crypto price correction.

## [Bitcoin ETFs Rebound Amid Market Rally as $500M Reenter Funds](https://decrypt.co/310691/bitcoin-etfs-rebound-amid-market-rally)

Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have generated more than $500 million in net inflows over the past three days, regaining lost ground amid a small rally in the funds underlying asset and wider gains in risk-on assets.
The ARK21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) were responsible for almost all these increases with ARKB receiving $180 million in net inflows over the three-day period, according  to data from U.K. as...

But Powell shrugged off concerns in a press conference Wednesday, claiming that Trump's tariffs will have a "transitory" effect on inflation.

As expected, the U.S. central bank left its benchmark rate at 4.25% to 4.50% on Wednesday. The Fed [cut](https://decrypt.co/250182/fed-cuts-interest-rates-for-first-time-in-four-years) borrowing costs in September for the first time in four years, ahead of sizable gains for both crypto and stocks—with the surge only accelerating once President Trump won November's election.

"The shift from outflows to inflows over the last three days signifies growing confidence driven by BTC's price stabilization and institutional interest," Alan Orwick, co-founder of layer 1 protocol [Quai Network](https://qu.ai/), wrote in an email to _Decrypt_.

The surge follows [five weeks of net outflows](https://decrypt.co/310160/crypto-etfs-shed-a-record-6-4-billion) that occurred as crypto and other markets slumped—a result of investor jitters about a looming trade war, geo-political tensions and other macroeconomic uncertainties. [Bitcoin's price](https://decrypt.co/price/bitcoin) was recently trading at about $84,500, up more than 3% over the past 24 hours, although the largest cryptocurrency by market value is down more than 11% during the past month, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.

More than [68% of prediction market traders](https://myriad.markets/markets/bitcoin-price-above-83-000-on-march-23-2025-at-11-59pm-utc) on MYRIAD believe that Bitcoin's price will remain above $83,000 as of March 23. (MYRIAD is owned by _Decrypt_'s parent company, DASTAN.)

Stocks were up Tuesday as investors awaited the latest interest rate decision and signs that the U.S. central bank would continue its quantitative easing, a boon for risk-on assets.

Orwick noted: "As the end of the quarter approaches, institutional investors are adjusting their portfolios to align with strategic asset allocations, which this rebalancing leading to increased investments in assets such as BTC ETFs, especially if Bitcoin has under or overperformed relative to other holdings."

The 11 Bitcoin ETFs, which began trading last year, have been wildly successful and now manage roughly $100 billion in assets. IBIT alone has generated nearly $40 billion in net inflows, despite shedding assets as Bitcoin's price dropped in recent weeks.

Looming economic issues, including the increased prospect of a recession have trumped U.S. President Donald Trump's crypto-friendly policies.
