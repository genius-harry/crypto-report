Russia has started using crypto for oil trades with China and India as it seeks to bypass Western sanctions, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-leans-cryptocurrencies-oil-trade-sources-say-2025-03-14/) on March 14, citing sources familiar with the matter.

According to the report, some Russian oil companies have settled trades in [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/), [Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/), and stablecoins like Tether’s [USDT](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/). This strategy simplifies the conversion of Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupees into Russian Rubles, enabling smoother transactions despite financial restrictions.

Typically, a Chinese buyer deposits Yuan into an offshore account controlled by an intermediary. The funds are then converted into crypto and transferred through multiple accounts before reaching a final destination in Russia, where they are exchanged for Rubles.

These transactions reportedly reach tens of millions of dollars per month.

Although crypto adoption in Russia’s oil trade remains limited, it is [part of a broader trend](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-firms-turn-to-bitcoin-stablecoins-for-global-trade-amid-sanctions/). Over the past year, the country has [introduced new regulations](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-contemplating-permanently-legalizing-stablecoins-for-cross-border-payments/) governing [crypto mining](https://cryptoslate.com/russias-bitcoin-mining-demand-triples-amid-regulatory-shifts-and-price-rally/), taxation, and international trade.

[Western sanctions imposed over Russia’s](https://cryptoslate.com/tether-freezes-27m-on-garantex-forcing-halt-of-russian-linked-exchange/) military actions in Ukraine have accelerated this shift toward digital assets. However, industry sources suggest oil firms may continue using cryptocurrencies even if sanctions are lifted due to their efficiency and transaction speed.

## Digital rubles challenges

While Russia increases its reliance on crypto for trade, its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project is facing significant hurdles.

Last month, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina [announced](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-delays-digital-ruble-cbdc-launch-extends-pilot-phase-indefinitely/) an indefinite delay in the launch of the digital ruble. She attributed the setback to the need for further refinements to ensure that the currency benefits all stakeholders.

However, a recent survey indicates that the digital ruble launch was postponed due to the inadequate IT infrastructure of banks that were expected to handle the project.

The survey of Russian banking experts revealed that 30% of financial institutions are not yet prepared to support the digital ruble. Experts explained that implementing the CBDC requires banks to upgrade their IT systems to handle increased transaction volumes.

Meanwhile, 20% of banking IT specialists stated that their systems are fully equipped for the digital ruble. Another 50% said they are partially prepared but need further upgrades.

At the same time, around 14% of the respondents expressed concerns over potential information security risks associated with the currency.

Given these challenges, Russia’s national digital asset initiative could face further obstacles unless major financial institutions fully prepare for its adoption.

Proof-of-Work security: Mike Siers on AuthLN’s bold vision for cyber defense

In a recent SlateCast episode, CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief, Liam “Akiba” Wright, spoke with AuthLN Founder Mike Siers about leveraging Bitcoin’s Lightning Network to address the massive problem of cybercrime. Drawing on his background as a military veteran, Siers explained how his proof-of-work-based authentication approach can impose genuine costs on would-be attackers.Mounting Cyber Threats and the Need for ChangeModern society relies heavily on digital infrastructure, yet hacks and data breaches continue to escalate. According to Siers, losses from cybercrime in 2024 alone are estimated at 9.5 trillion dollars, far eclipsing the comparatively smaller sums often highlighted in crypto-related thefts.“There are massive cyber attacks happening every single day,” he said. “We’re just going on as if everything is normal and our entire world is anchored online.”Siers argued that current security measures, such as firewalls and password protections, often act more like puzzles that attackers can eventually solve. “At the end of the day… attackers have the advantage of time,” he pointed out. “There really is no deterrence factor.”Introducing Proof-of-Work AuthenticationAuthLN seeks to close this gap by applying Bitcoin’s proof-of-work concept to authentication. As Siers put it:“What AuthLN is doing is introducing a cost mechanism via proof of work that wasn’t there before, that you’re going to need to satisfy prior to making any authentication attempt.”In practical terms, users (especially at an enterprise or nation-state level) must place a certain amount of Bitcoin as collateral through the Lightning Network before even trying to log in. If credentials fail to match, the collateral is forfeited—instantly turning break-in attempts into a costly gamble. Conversely, authorized users who “fat-finger” a password can still be protected by arrangements between AuthLN and their organization.Why the Lightning Network?Asked why AuthLN turned to Bitcoin, Siers highlighted the ro

Sunny Aggarwal details how Polaris unlocks effortless multi-chain trading Experiences

In a recent episode of the SlateCast, Sunny Aggarwal, Co-founder of Osmosis Labs and Polaris, joined CryptoSlate’s Editor in Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright to discuss the future of cross-chain decentralized finance (DeFi), the rise of multi-chain ecosystems, and his new venture, Polaris. Aggarwal delved into the innovations within Cosmos, the role of Bitcoin in decentralized finance, and Polaris’s goal to unify trading across various blockchain networks.Bitcoin’s Growing Integration with DeFiAggarwal started by discussing the evolving role of Bitcoin within the Cosmos ecosystem. He emphasized that the decentralized finance landscape is increasingly incorporating Bitcoin, which he sees as essential for a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem. “Bitcoin DeFi is continuing to grow and happen,” he said, referring to the expansion of DeFi layers, such as ThorChain, that bring Bitcoin into decentralized applications.Osmosis, Aggarwal’s previous project, has integrated various Bitcoin bridges, including Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), NOMIC, and CKBTC. These integrations provide additional trading options for users and help expand Bitcoin’s use case in Cosmos. “Alloyed Bitcoin is live on Osmosis and is one of our most traded assets,” Aggarwal noted, highlighting how these new offerings have significantly increased activity within the platform.Polaris: A Unified Platform for Multi-Chain TradingAggarwal’s latest venture, Polaris, aims to tackle one of DeFi’s greatest challenges: fragmented liquidity across chains. Centralized exchanges allow users to trade across multiple assets, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, on one platform, while decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have traditionally been limited by chain-specific liquidity pools. Polaris seeks to overcome this limitation by creating a platform that aggregates liquidity across ecosystems, allowing users to execute cross-chain trades seamlessly.“On centralized exchanges, you can trade Bitcoin, ETH, and SOL all in one spot, but on DEXs, you ne

How Leona Hiroki's INTMAX brings stateless scaling and privacy to Ethereum

In a recent episode of the SlateCast, CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill sat down with Leona Hioki, the Co-founder of INTMAX. The conversation delved into the transformative potential of stateless zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups), which prioritize privacy, scalability, and decentralization. Hioki’s insights shed light on INTMAX’s unique approach to blockchain infrastructure, the influence of Japanese engineering culture, and the broader impact of privacy on the crypto landscape.A New Paradigm in Blockchain ScalabilityHioki introduced INTMAX as a “stateless ZK-rollup” with features like near-zero gas fees, privacy by default, and interoperability with other blockchains. Unlike traditional rollups that store transaction data on-chain, INTMAX’s stateless architecture allows data to be managed off-chain and verified using cryptographic proofs.“We’re aiming for extreme scalability by shifting data and computation to the client side,” Hioki explained.This allows for significantly reduced costs and improved privacy for users.INTMAX’s system offers a distinct trade-off compared to traditional ZK-rollups. By moving computation to users’ devices, the burden on blockchain nodes is minimized, resulting in a lightweight infrastructure.“We’ve achieved something unique in the blockchain space — extreme scalability and privacy without compromising decentralization,” Hioki noted.The Stateless Architecture AdvantageINTMAX’s stateless approach challenges the norm of blockchain rollups, which typically store transaction history on-chain. Hioki emphasized that INTMAX’s design is inspired by “Plasma Prime,” an early concept for off-chain scaling solutions. He highlighted that the key to INTMAX’s architecture is "parallelizing computation and storage,” which shifts most of the processing work to end-user devices, reducing reliance on the blockchain’s infrastructure.“If you’ve got 5 million users, that’s 5 million nodes working in parallel instead o

Mapping the future: Brent van der Heiden on MapMetrics, drive-to-earn, and the power of DePIN

In the latest episode of the SlateCast, CryptoSlate Editor-in-Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright sat down with Brent van der Heiden, the founder and CEO of MapMetrics. The conversation delved deep into how MapMetrics is revolutionizing navigation, data privacy, and user incentives through the emerging DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) sector.From Navigation to Data MonetizationMapMetrics introduces a “drive-to-earn” model, offering users a way to earn crypto rewards by contributing traffic and navigation data. Unlike traditional GPS services that monetize users’ data without compensation, MapMetrics puts the power — and the profit — back into users’ hands.“What we came to realize is that almost all the DePINs need a map to showcase where the data is located,” Brent explained. “So we’re building kind of like the renewed Google Maps — but for DePIN.”By enabling users to contribute data anonymously, MapMetrics positions itself as a privacy-first alternative to big tech services. “You don’t have to fill in your real name or your email address. You can just fake something and then we don’t have your data,” said Brent.Creating Value Through CrowdsourcingA cornerstone of MapMetrics’ platform is incentivized crowdsourcing. Users contribute not only live traffic data but also rich metadata like menu photos, street updates, or local business details. This data feeds into an evolving map powered by both users and AI tools.“We’re going to send people on quests and use our AI tools to fill the data gaps,” Brent explained. “For example, if you take a picture of a restaurant menu, we’ll extract dishes, ingredients, and prices. Then users can search not just by cuisine, but by the specific dish they want.”This innovative fusion of human input and machine intelligence is driving a smarter, more personalized navigation experience. It’s a shift from basic search results to AI-powered decision-making.The B2B Revenue Engine Behind the VisionTo sustain its tokenomics and rewa
