Summary: US President Donald Trump's announcement to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile has sparked increased trading activity among Indian crypto enthusiasts. While this might signal an incoming crypto rally, do not ignore the market's inherent volatility and risks associated with hype-driven investments. Moreover, regulatory ambiguity around this asset class is another reason you should be careful while investing in this asset.
