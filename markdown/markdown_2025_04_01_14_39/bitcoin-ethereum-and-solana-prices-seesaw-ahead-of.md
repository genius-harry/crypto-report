[Discover SCENE](https://decrypt.co/scene)

The price of Bitcoin fell to a two-week low on Monday before recovering some losses, as other major cryptocurrencies also seesawed two days ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s deadline to impose steep tariffs.

The leading digital asset edged up 1% to $83,465, according to crypto data provider [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin). Ethereum, the second largest crypto by market capitalization, rose 1.1% to about $1,840, while Solana, the sixth largest, climbed 1.4% to over $125.

The upturn comes as investors look toward April 2, when Trump plans on announcing the tariffs in a ceremony scheduled for the White House Rose Garden. The crypto market has been teetering amid widespread market jitters as investors reel from Trump’s erratic trade policies.

Bitcoin’s price was recently down 23% from its record high of $108,800 set on Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration day. On Monday, the S&P 500 fell again into correction territory, sinking more than 10% below the market index’s peak in January, before regaining some ground.

Bitcoin price fell as low as $81,500 after [_The Wall Street Journal_](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-says-he-couldnt-care-less-if-car-prices-go-up-b9b4a211) reported that Trump has recently pushed advisors to be more aggressive on tariffs on Sunday. A week ago, it changed hands around $88,500, as it appeared Trump might impose more [limited](https://decrypt.co/311300/white-house-tariffs-bitcoin-economic-jitters) measures.

After tilting toward “Extreme Fear,” or a value of 20 last month, the [Crypto Fear & Greed Index](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/), a measure of investor sentiment, has since climbed to “Fear,” or a value of 34. Prediction market traders on MYRIAD [foresee](https://myriad.markets/markets/fear-and-greed-index-at-30-or-higher-on-april-2) an 80% chance that the index will be at 30 or above on Tuesday. (Disclosure: MYRIAD is owned by Decrypt’s parent company, DASTAN.)

Ethereum and other altcoins have been hit much harder than Bitcoin since last January, with ETH’s price dropping to a 17-month low of $1,784 on Monday—a 16% fall over the past month.

## [Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP Fall to Weekly Lows as Liquidations Spike Above $450 Million](https://decrypt.co/312163/bitcoin-ethereum-xrp-weekly-lows-liquidations)

Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies are in the red Friday, with top coins falling to their lowest prices in at least a week as stock markets are similarly rattled by hotter-than-expected inflation data.
The price of Bitcoin dipped to $83,609 early Friday afternoon, and is currently down about 4% on the day at a current price of $83,736. It's down just 0.4% on the week, but the Friday slide has cooled rising momentum seen in recent days.
Other top coins have shown sharper losses over the pas...

The volatile start to the week followed some positive signs last week when investors allocated $195 million to Bitcoin investment products, per CoinShares. The crypto asset manager [noted](https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-227-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-b8acc1fc9411) in a report on Monday that recent activity resembled “positive but cautious behavior.”

Some analysts believe that markets have digested the bulk of Trump’s tariff threats and that [Bitcoin’s price has bottomed](https://decrypt.co/311539/has-the-bitcoin-market-bottomed-experts-weigh-in). Still, many have pointed to Trump’s “Liberation Day” on April 2 as a wild card, given that the White House’s stance on tariffs has shifted frequently.

Gold, the traditional safe-haven asset that has rallied alongside Trump’s trade utterances, set a new record on Monday. The precious metal was recently [changing hands](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/gold) at around $3,153 per ounce, up more than 1%.

Bitcoin’s advocates often portray the cryptocurrency as a store of value, but it’s been tracking equities recently, especially the Nasdaq, according to researcher Noelle Acheson. The tech-heavy index and Bitcoin’s price have each fallen over 5% in the past week.

"BTC is reminding us that it is seen as a risk asset by many,” Acheson wrote in a Telegram message to _Decrypt_ on Friday. “Risk sentiment is weak, largely due to uncertainty around the impact of tariffs and growing doubts, even among Fed officials, that rate cuts are coming any time soon.”

Monday marks the end to what has been a tumultuous quarter for the crypto market. Bitcoin is on track to finish down 11% from the beginning of January, while Ethereum is slated to record a 45% fall, according to the crypto data provider [CoinGlass](https://www.coinglass.com/today).

Japan’s biggest Bitcoin treasury company, Metaplanet, has issued more debt to buy the cryptocurrency.
The firm, which trades on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, said Monday that it had issued a two billion yen ($13.3 million) zero-coupon ordinary bond to fund more Bitcoin buys.
Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich made the announcement on X, saying the company—which is also an investment firm that owns a hotel—was “buying the dip.”

The world's richest man [Elon Musk](https://decrypt.co/312348/elon-musk-us-government-no-plans-dogecoin) appears to have greenlit the revival of old school video app [Vine](https://decrypt.co/79083/vine-cofounder-playable-video-games-ethereum-nfts), after an xAI employee announced that the company has acquired the defunct mobile app.

In response, the [Pump.fun](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-pump-fun-the-solana-meme-coin-factory) launched Vine Coin, [VINE](https://decrypt.co/zh-Hans/price/vine), created by the app’s co-founder, has spiked 122% over the past three days.

Not long after, the co-founder of Vine, [Rus Yusupov](https://x.com/rus), launched a Solana meme coin hinting that the app’s return could possibly use the token, prompting it to quickly touch a $498 million market cap.

But that was short-lived. It has since fallen 89% to $55 million.

Official Trump (TRUMP), a token endorsed by the U.S. President, has jumped 12.4% over the past 24 hours—his wife’s official token Melania Meme (MELANIA) is also up nearly 2%. This comes the morning after Donald Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister, Benja...

Musk [responded](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1905787273649561721) “feel free to take that on,” with many taking this as the billionaire greenlighting the revival. Yusupov reposted the exchange.

Vine Coin pumped 110% from Friday into Saturday to a market cap of $52 million, following the Musk interaction. The token then retraced 41% to $30.55 million on Sunday, before spiking another 80% to $55 million on Monday. Over the entire three day period, the coin climbed 122%, according to [DEX Screener](https://dexscreener.com/solana/58fzjmbx5patnfjpqwwsqkvfprkptkbb5r2vcw4qq3z9).

[Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/event/x-relaunches-vine-before-july) betters believe there is a 24% chance that X relaunches Vine before July, down from 58% at the end of January.

Alongside the launch of Vine Coin, Yusupov [created a website](https://www.vineco.in/) of the same name which includes a waitlist. This has spurred on rumors that the popular app will soon return— and might even incorporate the token.

## [Elon Musk's DOGE Exploring Blockchain for Government Efficiency: Bloomberg](https://decrypt.co/302740/elon-musk-doge-blockchain-government-efficiency)

The Department of Government Efficiency, the cost-cutting initiative led by billionaire Elon Musk, is reportedly considering the use of a public blockchain to bring transparency and other potential benefits to government operations and spending.

Musk has previously toyed with using cryptocurrencies in his business ventures, including accepting Dogecoin for Tesla vehicles and [investing in crypto](https://decrypt.co/286456/elon-musk-tesla-moves-bitcoin) through his companies. More recently, it was reported that the billionaire was pondering the use of a public blockchain [for the Department of Government Efficiency](https://decrypt.co/302740/elon-musk-doge-blockchain-government-efficiency), although this hasn’t come to fruition yet.

Similarly, [co-founder of Venmo Iqram Magdon-Ismail](https://decrypt.co/310053/solana-meme-coin-jellyjelly-app-sweet-start) has created a podcasting app called [JellyJelly](https://youtu.be/iFn0jJZDg0Q?si=VaQj96gxd-winIDb) that utilizes a Pump.fun token of the same name for a [tipping feature](https://x.com/jellyvideochats/status/1906060541082190255).
