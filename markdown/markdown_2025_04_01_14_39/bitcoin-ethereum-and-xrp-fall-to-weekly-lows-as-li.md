Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies are in the red Friday, with top coins falling to their lowest prices in at least a week as stock markets are similarly rattled by [hotter-than-expected inflation data](https://decrypt.co/312110/bitcoin-price-altcoins-inflation-february).

The price of Bitcoin dipped to $83,609 early Friday afternoon, and is currently down about 4% on the day at a current price of $83,736. It's down just 0.4% on the week, but the Friday slide has cooled rising momentum seen in recent days.

Other top coins have shown sharper losses over the past day, however, with Ethereum down 6% to $1,875 and XRP falling about 7% to $2.17. Both fell to weekly lows on Friday alongside Bitcoin.

[BTC price](https://decrypt.co/price/bitcoin)

Solana and Dogecoin are also in the red Friday, down 6% and 4.5% respectively over the past day, though both coins remain up over the last week.

Amid the declines, crypto liquidations have surged over the past day, tallying more than $450 million as of this writing per data from [CoinGlass](https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData). Long positions make up the bulk of the carnage at $402 million, and Ethereum is the biggest contributor to liquidations with $136 million worth in total. Bitcoin is next at $118 million.

Both the Dow and S&P 500 indices are down more than 2% Friday, with traders reacting to continued inflation fears and the impact of Trump's ever-evolving trade tariffs on other nations. The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) [rose 0.4% in February](https://decrypt.co/312110/bitcoin-price-altcoins-inflation-february), as reported Friday—a higher market than expected and the biggest monthly leap in more than a year.

## [Bitcoin Price Wavers, Altcoins Plunge as Inflation Heats Up](https://decrypt.co/312110/bitcoin-price-altcoins-inflation-february)

The Bitcoin price fell below $85,000 on Friday as investors digested a hotter-than-expected inflation print amid uncertainty surrounding the latest tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump.
The core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) rose 0.4% in February, marking its largest monthly increase in over a year, the U.S. Commerce Department reported on Friday. Economists had expected the index to show a 0.3% increase, per Trading Economics.
The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation...

"Today's price action shows that investors are not ready for a long-term tariff engagement by the U.S.," Mark Connors, chief investment strategist for Bitcoin investment advisory Risk Dimensions, told _Decrypt_. "Portfolio managers are taking risk off the table to fight another day, until the impact of tariffs have greater clarity."

Nvidia's stock is down about 1.5% on the day, while the Nvidia-backed cloud computing firm CoreWeave—which began trading Friday—is down by about 1% as of this writing.

But crypto stocks are taking much harder hits than the broader markets, with Strategy (MSTR) down about 10% on the day and Coinbase falling by nearly 7% as of this writing.

Connors also noted the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's gloominess about GDP in the current quarter: "So today's move validates what Atlanta Fed GDPNow forecast has versus what the Street has. That, to me, is the real signal out of today."

The price of Bitcoin fell to a two-week low on Monday before recovering some losses, as other major cryptocurrencies also seesawed two days ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s deadline to impose steep tariffs.
The leading digital asset edged up 1% to $83,465, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Ethereum, the second largest crypto by market capitalization, rose 1.1% to about $1,840, while Solana, the sixth largest, climbed 1.4% to over $125.

## [Metaplanet Accelerates Bitcoin Buying Strategy, Issues $13.3 Million in New Bonds](https://decrypt.co/312459/metaplanet-accelerates-bitcoin-buying-strategy)



Japan’s biggest Bitcoin treasury company, Metaplanet, has issued more debt to buy the cryptocurrency.
The firm, which trades on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, said Monday that it had issued a two billion yen ($13.3 million) zero-coupon ordinary bond to fund more Bitcoin buys.
Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich made the announcement on X, saying the company—which is also an investment firm that owns a hotel—was “buying the dip.”

## [Solana Meme Coin Spikes as Elon Musk Hints at Vine Revival](https://decrypt.co/312454/elon-musk-vine-revival-solana-meme-coin)



The world's richest man Elon Musk appears to have greenlit the revival of old school video app Vine, after an xAI employee announced that the company has acquired the defunct mobile app.
In response, the Pump.fun launched Vine Coin, VINE, created by the app’s co-founder, has spiked 122% over the past three days.

The [Bitcoin price](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bitcoin-four-minute-instant-guide-explainer) fell below $85,000 on Friday as investors digested a hotter-than-expected inflation print amid uncertainty surrounding the latest tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump.

The core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) rose 0.4% in February, marking its largest monthly increase in over a year, the U.S. Commerce Department [reported](https://www.bea.gov/news/2025/personal-income-and-outlays-february-2025) on Friday. Economists had expected the index to show a 0.3% increase, per [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/core-pce-price-index-mom).

The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge showed a 2.8% increase annually, surpassing economists' forecasts of 2.7%. The core measure excludes volatile food and energy prices, serving as a more reliable measure of underlying inflation trends for experts.

As of Friday morning Eastern Time, Bitcoin was on track to finish the week up 2.3%, despite punching above $88,000 earlier this week, according to the crypto data provider [CoinGecko](https://decrypt.co/price/bitcoin). At the time of writing, Bitcoin had sunk below $85,000 and was trading 3.3% lower than this time yesterday.

The [Crypto Fear & Greed Index](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/) has climbed out of the "extreme fear" zone it was in a month ago, but [90% of Myriad Market](https://myriad.markets/markets/fear-and-greed-index-at-45-or-higher-on-march-29) users think it won't exceed 45 by the end of the day—even though at the time of writing it has risen to 44.

Meanwhile, the [Ethereum price](https://decrypt.co/price/ethereum) led the alt plunge, trading 4.7% lower than it was this time yesterday. Solana has sunk to $129 in the past day after having lost 5.8%. Similarly, XRP has dropped to $2.20 after having fallen 5.7%.

“Bitcoin continues to demonstrate its resilience,” Matt Mena, a research analyst at the crypto asset manager 21Shares wrote in a Friday note, describing the leading cryptocurrency as “a non-sovereign, inflation-resistant asset that can weather all market cycles.”

On a monthly basis, consumer spending increased 0.4% in February, reversing a 0.3% drop from the previous month. Still, the measure fell short of a 0.5% increase, as economists expected, suggesting the U.S. economy is lagging as inflation ticks up.

“It starts confirming some of the worst fears around persistent inflation,” Carlos Guzman, a research analyst at the crypto market marker GSR told _Decrypt_, saying Friday’s report could escalate “potential fears of stagflation.”

## [Has the Bitcoin Market Bottomed? Experts Weigh In](https://decrypt.co/311539/has-the-bitcoin-market-bottomed-experts-weigh-in)

How low could Bitcoin go?
To quote Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett: “I don’t believe anybody knows what the market is going to do tomorrow.”
Still, investors have been searching for answers since Bitcoin’s price started dipping after U.S. President Donald Trump’s inauguration. Amid twists and turns in his trade policy, Bitcoin’s price hit $77,000 two weeks ago, according to the crypto data provider CoinGecko.
Even though the asset's price was changing hands around $88,000 on...

Investors are bracing for a tariff deadline next week, when the Trump administration is scheduled to implement a new round of tariffs. While the president has tried to [calm jitters](https://decrypt.co/311539/has-the-bitcoin-market-bottomed-experts-weigh-in) ahead of April 2, he [unveiled](https://apnews.com/article/autos-tariffs-trump-tax-imports-ford-gm-e53823ef7bbb7b3c46d11eca90aaa638) 25% tariffs on vehicle imports on Thursday.

Gold, another non-sovereign asset, has rallied alongside twists and turns in Trump’s trade policy. The precious metal [surged](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/gold) to a record high of $3,080 per ounce on Friday.

With core PCE slightly higher than expected, the Fed may continue to hold interest rates steady at its next meeting, Mena said. Earlier this month, the central bank [extended](https://decrypt.co/310718/bitcoin-wavers-as-fed-holds-rates-steady) a months-long pause on reducing borrowing costs, pointing to Trump’s tariffs as an inflationary wild card.
