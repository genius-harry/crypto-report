## Key Points:

- Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP have all broken key support levels, signaling potential for deeper losses.
- Trump's upcoming reciprocal tariffs are fueling a global risk-off shift, pressuring crypto markets.
- Safe-haven assets like gold and the yen are surging as investors flee from stocks and risk assets.

Crypto markets are showing signs of technical strain just as fresh macroeconomic risks begin to surface.

Bitcoin ( [BTC](https://www.fxempire.com/crypto/bitcoin)), Ethereum ( [ETH](https://www.fxempire.com/crypto/ethereum)), and XRP ( [XRP](https://www.fxempire.com/crypto/ripple)) have all painted bearish chart structures, suggesting the potential for deeper drawdowns. These developments come as escalating global trade tensions are already testing investor sentiment.

Former President Donald Trump will implement reciprocal tariffs starting April 2, triggering fears of an economic slowdown and fueling a broader risk-off shift across global markets. With capital moving out of equities and into traditional safe havens, digital assets may struggle to hold current levels.

Let’s analyze how low BTC, ETH, and XRP can go amid the ongoing trade war.

## **Bitcoin Bear Flag Breakdown Hints $73K**

Bitcoin (BTC) has slipped from its bear flag pattern following its recent correction from yearly highs.

As of March 31, BTC/USD was trading near $81,830 on Bitstamp, confirming a breakdown below a multi-week upward-sloping channel. This setup followed a sharp down-move earlier in March and resembles a classic continuation structure.

![BTC/USD daily price char](https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2025/03/BTCUSD_2025-03-31_11-56-23.png?func=crop&q=70)

Technically, the height of the initial decline, when projected from the breakdown point, yields a downside target near $73,000.

Momentum indicators are flashing early warnings: the daily RSI is hovering around 40.89, signaling fading bullish strength.

## **Ethereum Breaches Triangle Support, $1,690 in Sight**

Ethereum (ETH) has also fallen below a key support structure — an ascending triangle formed throughout March.

Typically a bullish pattern, the triangle failed to deliver an upside breakout, instead unraveling below its rising trendline. As of writing, ETH/USD trades at $1,799, down nearly 0.4% daily.

![ETH/USD three-day price chart](https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2025/03/ETHUSD_2025-03-31_12-01-19.png?func=crop&q=70)

The breakdown opens the door to a measured move toward $1,690, derived from the pattern’s height. RSI has dropped to 33.79, nearing oversold territory but still lacking signs of bullish divergence.

The declining buy volume, which has failed to support the uptrend through March, adds to the bearish pressure. A failed retest of the $2,000 level could confirm ETH’s bearish trajectory for the weeks ahead.

## **XRP Faces Major Breakdown Risk From Triangle Pattern**

XRP is facing heightened downside risk as it continues to trade near the lower boundary of a descending triangle — a pattern that often signals bearish continuation.

XRP/USD is currently priced around $2.07, down over 6% in the past 24 hours. The pattern has developed over the past few months, marked by lower highs and consistent support near the $2.00 level.

![XRP/USD three-day price chart](https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2025/03/XRPUSD_2025-03-31_12-04-13.png?func=crop&q=70)

A decisive break below this support would validate the triangle structure and trigger a potential plunge toward $1.22, a move that represents a nearly 40% decline.

The RSI reading of 43.82 remains weak, and the broader volume structure shows declining buyer conviction. Unless bulls defend the $2.00 floor, XRP could be headed for a significant drawdown.

## **Risk-Off Sentiment Deepens as Tariffs Loom**

The technical breakdowns across major cryptocurrencies come as global markets prepare for [Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariff rollout](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/bitcoin-may-slip-below-80k-as-trump-spooks-risk-traders-1507487), which begins April 2. While details remain sparse, the tariffs are expected to affect all countries and compound existing steel, aluminum, and autos levies.

This macro uncertainty prompts money managers to reduce exposure to equities and shift into safer assets such as [bonds](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/gold-price-hits-all-time-high-amid-falling-yields-and-weakening-us-dollar-1508115), [gold](https://www.fxempire.com/commodities/gold), and the [Japanese yen](https://www.fxempire.com/currencies/usd-jpy). As a result, stocks are in decline, with the [S&P 500 suffering its worst quarter since 2022](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/sp500-will-defensive-sectors-lead-again-as-traders-brace-for-trade-policy-clarity-1508086), shedding $5 trillion in market value since peaking on February 19.

Signs of economic strain are beginning to surface. Last week’s data revealed a sharp drop in [U.S. consumer sentiment](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/michigan-consumer-sentiment-drops-to-57-0-sp500-tests-session-lows-1507885) and a surge in inflation expectations.

Meanwhile, gold hit a record high of $3,115.97 per ounce, marking a 19% year-to-date rally with at least 15 new all-time highs. The yen has also gained 0.7% compared to the dollar as demand for haven currencies increases.

Since top cryptocurrencies have historically mirrored global risk-on trends, this deteriorating macro backdrop could amplify the downside already indicated by technical charts.

Until risk sentiment stabilizes or new bullish catalysts emerge, digital assets may remain vulnerable to further corrections.
