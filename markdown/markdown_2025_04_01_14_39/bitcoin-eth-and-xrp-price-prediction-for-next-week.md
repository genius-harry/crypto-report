In March, the crypto-verse slashed 4.301%, from $2.79 Trillion to $2.67 Trillion. Following this, the Bitcoin price displayed a similar action by losing 4.36% during this period.

On the other hand, the altcoin leader, Ethereum price displayed a bloodbath by erasing 21.26% from its valuation in March. Hope had arisen during the 3rd week with the Ripple vs SEC case dismissal, however, the XRP price chocked, resulting in it concluding the month on a bearish hand.

With this, the billion dollar questions arises, what’s next for Bitcoin, Ethereum, & XRP cryptocurrencies during the upcoming week. Let us understand the possible short-term price predictions of these projects individually to clear out the queries!

## Bitcoin Price Crash Below $80k in April?

Bitcoin price today has dropped by 2.34%, resulting in it plunging below its important support trendline of $83,000. Moreover, it has failed to match the expectations of the marketers by breaking down the triangle pattern in the daily time frame. This raises speculations of it recording a new multi-month low.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has experienced a bearish convergence in the daily time frame. This indicates an increase in the selling pressure over the buying pressure for the BTC price.

Furthermore, the Simple Moving Average (SMA) displays a similar price action by recording a negative crossover in the Bitcoin price chart. This suggests a bearish outlook for the latest cryptocurrency by market cap during the upcoming week.

A sustained negative trend action could result in the BTC price retesting its $80k mark. Moreover, increased liquidation could push the price toward its crucial low of $78,535 before a potential rise. However, if a bullish reversal occurs, the price of Bitcoin could retest its important resistance zone of $88,000.

## ETH Price To Break Toward Its $1,500 Crucial Support?

By breaking below its important support of $2,000, the Ethereum price is now headed toward its low of $1,800 this weekend. Reportedly, the Ethereum price has dropped 1.32% in 24 hours and 6.87% over the last seven days. This has resulted in it reducing its dominance to 8.3373%.

The technical indicators RSI & SMA have both recorded a rising negative trend in the daily time frame. Reportedly, this raises concern for a potential sustained bearish action for the largest altcoin in the coming days.

Suppose, a bullish reversal occurs, under such a situation, the price of Ethereum coin could bounce back toward its immediate resistance level of $2,000. Negatively, an intensified bearish run could result in it plunging toward its multi-year low of $1,500.

## XRP Price On The Path of Retesting the $2 Mark?

Despite the conclusion of the XRP vs SEC lawsuit, the Ripple token has not made notable progress. Moreover, the altcoin has failed to hold its ground at the $2.50 mark. Reportedly, it has corrected by 2.77% in 24 hours in spite of recording a trading volume of over $4 billion.

As the market turns bearish, the technical indicators witness a significant drop in the XRP price chart. Moreover, with the bears strengthening their hold, the XRP token may continue trading under a bearish influence during the first part of April.

Considering the present market situation, the chances of XRP coin price retesting its crucial support of $2 is relatively high. Notably, a potential bullish reversal cannot be ignored as this could result in the 2nd largest altcoin experiencing a bounce back toward its immediate barrier of $2.48.

## Endnote:

With the rising tariff wars among the top nations, not only the crypto market but the world market is suffering. However, with Trump’s tariff implementation on 02nd April 2025, the story could take a twist. However, there is no confirmation about the possibilities of the outcome.
