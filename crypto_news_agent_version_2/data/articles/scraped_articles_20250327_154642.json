Inflation forecasts were also revised higher, signaling a cautious outlook from\npolicymakers.\n\n\"The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased, FOMC statement read. \"The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.\"\n\nAdditionally, the institution also announced plans to\nslow the pace of its balance sheet runoff starting in April, adding another\nlayer of complexity to its monetary policy approach. The Fed’s latest economic projections now see U.S. GDP growing just 1.7%\nin 2025, down from the 2.1% forecast in December.\n\nGrowth estimates for 2026 and 2027 were also trimmed,\nreflecting growing uncertainty about the economic trajectory. “As with real activity and [inflation](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/inflation/), the outlook for\nthe future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable\nuncertainty,” the Fed stated, hinting at concerns over trade policies and other\nglobal economic risks.\n\n## Economic Growth and Inflation\n\nDespite economic headwinds, the Fed’s projections suggest policymakers still anticipate ending 2025 with a benchmark interest rate of 3.9%, implying only two rate cuts by year-end. The forecasts for 2026 and 2027 stand at 3.4% and 3.1%, respectively, reinforcing expectations that borrowing costs will remain elevated in the near term.\n\n![](https://images.financemagnates.com/images/Crypto%20reacts%20as%20Fed%20holds%20interest%20rates%20steady.jpg_id_198c4006-fdeb-4079-bfcf-0815895a4a9b_size900.jpg)\n\nCrypto reacts as Fed holds interest rates steady\n\nIn December, the central bank [forecast inflation at 2.5% for 2025 and GDP growth at 2.1%](https://www.financemagnates.com/trending/can-bitcoin-hold-100k-price-drops-as-fed-slashes-rates-again/). Given recent economic data, there is\nspeculation that the Fed may raise its inflation outlook while lowering its\ngrowth expectations.\n\nWith uncertainty surrounding economic growth,\ninflation, and future rate moves, the FOMC's latest meeting is now shaping investor sentiment. For crypto traders, the short-term volatility might\nbe significant, but in the broader context of digital asset markets, it remains\nbusiness as usual.\n\nThe Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate steady\nfor a second consecutive meeting, signaling concerns about slower economic\ngrowth and persistent inflation pressures.

Inflation forecasts were also revised higher, signaling a cautious outlook from\npolicymakers.\n\n\"The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased, FOMC statement read. \"The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.\"\n\nAdditionally, the institution also announced plans to\nslow the pace of its balance sheet runoff starting in April, adding another\nlayer of complexity to its monetary policy approach. The Fed’s latest economic projections now see U.S. GDP growing just 1.7%\nin 2025, down from the 2.1% forecast in December.\n\nGrowth estimates for 2026 and 2027 were also trimmed,\nreflecting growing uncertainty about the economic trajectory. “As with real activity and [inflation](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/inflation/), the outlook for\nthe future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable\nuncertainty,” the Fed stated, hinting at concerns over trade policies and other\nglobal economic risks.\n\n## Economic Growth and Inflation\n\nDespite economic headwinds, the Fed’s projections suggest policymakers still anticipate ending 2025 with a benchmark interest rate of 3.9%, implying only two rate cuts by year-end. The forecasts for 2026 and 2027 stand at 3.4% and 3.1%, respectively, reinforcing expectations that borrowing costs will remain elevated in the near term.\n\nCrypto reacts as Fed holds interest rates steady\n\nIn December, the central bank [forecast inflation at 2.5% for 2025 and GDP growth at 2.1%](https://www.financemagnates.com/trending/can-bitcoin-hold-100k-price-drops-as-fed-slashes-rates-again/). Given recent economic data, there is\nspeculation that the Fed may raise its inflation outlook while lowering its\ngrowth expectations.\n\nWith uncertainty surrounding economic growth,\ninflation, and future rate moves, the FOMC's latest meeting is now shaping investor sentiment. For crypto traders, the short-term volatility might\nbe significant, but in the broader context of digital asset markets, it remains\nbusiness as usual.\n\nTopics\n\n\n[bitcoin](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/bitcoin/) [Ethereum](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/ethereum/) [federal reserve](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/federal-reserve/)\n\nShare this article\n\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Bitcoin%2C%20Ethereum%2C%20XRP%20Surge%20As%20Fed%20Holds%20Interest%20Rates%20Steady&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F&hashtags=finance_magnates,fm&via=finance_magnates)\n\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F&title=Bitcoin%2C%20Ethereum%2C%20XRP%20Surge%20As%20Fed%20Holds%20Interest%20Rates%20Steady&summary=The%20Fed%20highlighted%20the%20concerns%20about%20slower%20economic%20growth%20and%20persistent%20inflation%20pressures.%0AAmid%20the%20announcement%2C%20cryptocurrencies%20market%20surged%2C%20with%20XRP%20leading%20by%20double-digit%20growth%20in%20the%20past%20day.)\n\n[Email](mailto:?subject=You%27re%20going%20to%20love%20it%3A%20Bitcoin%2C%20Ethereum%2C%20XRP%20Surge%20As%20Fed%20Holds%20Interest%20Rates%20Steady&body=Check%20out%20this%20article%20from%20Finance%20Magnates%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F)\n\n[Telegram](https://t.me/share/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F&text=Bitcoin%2C%20Ethereum%2C%20XRP%20Surge%20As%20Fed%20Holds%20Interest%20Rates%20Steady)\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F)\n\n[WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F)\n\n[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-xrp-surge-as-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady%2F&title=Bitcoin%2C%20Ethereum%2C%20XRP%20Surge%20As%20Fed%20Holds%20Interest%20Rates%20Steady)\n\nDisqus Comments\n\nWe were unable to load Disqus.

The Fed [cut](https://decrypt.co/250182/fed-cuts-interest-rates-for-first-time-in-four-years) borrowing costs in September for the first time in four years, ahead of sizable gains for both crypto and stocks—with the surge only accelerating once President Trump won November's election.\n\n_Edited by [Andrew Hayward](https://decrypt.co/author/andrew-hayward)_\n\n### Daily Debrief Newsletter\n\nStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.\n\nYour Email\n\nGet it!\n\nGet it!\n\n[iframe](https://a.mmin.io/horizontal-offers?profile=decryptco1&frameId=mm-widget_1e868729-1ca7-1dd6-1e9b-184026761a19&sid=user_13ad9fca-15be-1a65-1aa7-1467ef694b8d&pitchUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F310725%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-and-solana-rise-alongside-stocks-following-fed-comments&utm_campaign=horizontalOffers&utm_medium=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F310725%2Fbitcoin-ethereum-and-solana-rise-alongside-stocks-following-fed-comments&utm_source=decryptco)\n\n### Recommended News\n\n- ![USDC.

Tron’s TRX dipped after a surge 5% earlier in the day as memecoin trading picked up on the blockchain following a [no-fee update](https://www.coindesk.com/daybook-us/2025/03/19/crypto-daybook-americas-memecoins-take-off-on-tron-while-bitcoin-looks-to-fomc) in the Sunpump platform.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) rose 2% and remained steady under $84,000 in Asian evening hours ahead of the FOMC, where traders expect rates to be held steady. The $80,000 mark remains one to be watched, some say, as a break below would mean a critical support level vanishes.\n\nThe widely-watched ETH/BTC ratio - or the trading pair of ether against bitcoin - rose from 0.23 to 0.24 since Asian morning hours, indicative of a bump in demand for riskier ETH versus the perceived safety of bitcoin.\n\nEther rose on no immediate catalyst, but the mothership network has technical catalysts in the making. The Pectra upgrade, Ethereum's next major update, is currently in testing and aims to improve scalability, staking, and user experience with over 20 EIPs, including EIP-7702 (smart account functionality) and EIP-7251 (raising validator staking limits to 2,048 ETH).\n\nTesting began on Holesky in February 2025, followed by Sepolia in March, but faced challenges like transaction processing issues due to client incompatibilities. A new testnet, Hooli, launched on March 17, with Pectra testing scheduled for March 26. If successful, mainnet deployment is expected in late April or early May 2025.\n\n“BTC has found some support at the $80K, but that seems tenuous at best amid broader macro weakness,” traders at Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a broadcast message. “We won’t attempt to call the exact moment when the music stops, but in the short term, we struggle to identify meaningful tailwinds to reverse this rout.”\n\n“We will be watching closely for any dovish shifts, particularly on growth and inflation expectations. Given that it will take months for the impact of tariffs to ripple through the economy, we expect the Fed to remain in “wait-and-see” mode,” QCP added.\n\nMeanwhile, gold broke above $3,000 to new highs earlier Wednesday, leading to some eyeing an inverse correlation of the yellow metal with bitcoin.\n\n“Despite its historical correlation with gold as a macro hedge, Bitcoin's current divergence—falling while gold rises—suggests it's acting more like a risk asset, influenced by Fed policy uncertainty, profit-taking, and a shift to traditional safe-havens,” Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.\n\n“The FOMC outcome could either trigger a recovery if dovish or deepen the correction if hawkish, with bitcoin's short-term trajectory tied to broader economic signals rather than solely reinforcing its \"digital gold\" role,” Lee added.\n\n[Ether](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/ether) [Bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/bitcoin) [FOMC](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/fomc)\n\n##### [Shaurya Malwa](https://www.coindesk.com/author/shaurya-malwa)\n\nShaurya is the Co-Leader of the CoinDesk tokens and data team in Asia with a focus on crypto derivatives, DeFi, market microstructure, and protocol analysis.\n\nShaurya holds over $1,000 in BTC, ETH, SOL, AVAX, SUSHI, CRV, NEAR, YFI, YFII, SHIB, DOGE, USDT, USDC, BNB, MANA, MLN, LINK, XMR, ALGO, VET, CAKE, AAVE, COMP, ROOK, TRX, SNX, RUNE, FTM, ZIL, KSM, ENJ, CKB, JOE, GHST, PERP, BTRFLY, OHM, BANANA, ROME, BURGER, SPIRIT, and ORCA.\n\nHe provides over $1,000 to liquidity pools on Compound, Curve, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, BurgerSwap, Orca, AnySwap, SpiritSwap, Rook Protocol, Yearn Finance, Synthetix, Harvest, Redacted Cartel, OlympusDAO, Rome, Trader Joe, and SUN.\n\n[X icon](https://x.com/shauryamalwa \"X\") [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaurya-malwa-a78101102/ \"LinkedIn\") [Email](mailto:shaurya.malwa@coindesk.com \"Email\")\n\n[![Shaurya Malwa](https://www.coindesk.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2F1c7e071b6b9ef4d849b5edaa9d644a67043efe54-512x512.png%3Fw%3D64%26h%3D64%26fit%3Dcrop%26crop%3Dfocalpoint%26auto%3Dformat&w=1080&q=75)](https://www.coindesk.com/author/shaurya-malwa)\n\n[iframe](https://consentcdn.cookiebot.com/sdk/bc-v4.min.html)",

Tron’s TRX dipped after a surge 5% earlier in the day as memecoin trading picked up on the blockchain following a [no-fee update](https://www.coindesk.com/daybook-us/2025/03/19/crypto-daybook-americas-memecoins-take-off-on-tron-while-bitcoin-looks-to-fomc) in the Sunpump platform.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) rose 2% and remained steady under $84,000 in Asian evening hours ahead of the FOMC, where traders expect rates to be held steady. The $80,000 mark remains one to be watched, some say, as a break below would mean a critical support level vanishes.\n\nThe widely-watched ETH/BTC ratio - or the trading pair of ether against bitcoin - rose from 0.23 to 0.24 since Asian morning hours, indicative of a bump in demand for riskier ETH versus the perceived safety of bitcoin.\n\nEther rose on no immediate catalyst, but the mothership network has technical catalysts in the making. The Pectra upgrade, Ethereum's next major update, is currently in testing and aims to improve scalability, staking, and user experience with over 20 EIPs, including EIP-7702 (smart account functionality) and EIP-7251 (raising validator staking limits to 2,048 ETH).\n\nTesting began on Holesky in February 2025, followed by Sepolia in March, but faced challenges like transaction processing issues due to client incompatibilities. A new testnet, Hooli, launched on March 17, with Pectra testing scheduled for March 26. If successful, mainnet deployment is expected in late April or early May 2025.\n\n“BTC has found some support at the $80K, but that seems tenuous at best amid broader macro weakness,” traders at Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a broadcast message. “We won’t attempt to call the exact moment when the music stops, but in the short term, we struggle to identify meaningful tailwinds to reverse this rout.”\n\n“We will be watching closely for any dovish shifts, particularly on growth and inflation expectations. Given that it will take months for the impact of tariffs to ripple through the economy, we expect the Fed to remain in “wait-and-see” mode,” QCP added.\n\nMeanwhile, gold broke above $3,000 to new highs earlier Wednesday, leading to some eyeing an inverse correlation of the yellow metal with bitcoin.\n\n“Despite its historical correlation with gold as a macro hedge, Bitcoin's current divergence—falling while gold rises—suggests it's acting more like a risk asset, influenced by Fed policy uncertainty, profit-taking, and a shift to traditional safe-havens,” Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.\n\n“The FOMC outcome could either trigger a recovery if dovish or deepen the correction if hawkish, with bitcoin's short-term trajectory tied to broader economic signals rather than solely reinforcing its \"digital gold\" role,” Lee added.\n\n[Ether](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/ether) [Bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/bitcoin) [FOMC](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/fomc)\n\n##### [Shaurya Malwa](https://www.coindesk.com/author/shaurya-malwa)\n\nShaurya is the Co-Leader of the CoinDesk tokens and data team in Asia with a focus on crypto derivatives, DeFi, market microstructure, and protocol analysis.\n\nShaurya holds over $1,000 in BTC, ETH, SOL, AVAX, SUSHI, CRV, NEAR, YFI, YFII, SHIB, DOGE, USDT, USDC, BNB, MANA, MLN, LINK, XMR, ALGO, VET, CAKE, AAVE, COMP, ROOK, TRX, SNX, RUNE, FTM, ZIL, KSM, ENJ, CKB, JOE, GHST, PERP, BTRFLY, OHM, BANANA, ROME, BURGER, SPIRIT, and ORCA.\n\nHe provides over $1,000 to liquidity pools on Compound, Curve, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, BurgerSwap, Orca, AnySwap, SpiritSwap, Rook Protocol, Yearn Finance, Synthetix, Harvest, Redacted Cartel, OlympusDAO, Rome, Trader Joe, and SUN.\n\n[X icon](https://x.com/shauryamalwa \"X\") [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaurya-malwa-a78101102/ \"LinkedIn\") [Email](mailto:shaurya.malwa@coindesk.com \"Email\")\n\n[![Shaurya Malwa](https://www.coindesk.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2F1c7e071b6b9ef4d849b5edaa9d644a67043efe54-512x512.png%3Fw%3D64%26h%3D64%26fit%3Dcrop%26crop%3Dfocalpoint%26auto%3Dformat&w=1080&q=75)](https://www.coindesk.com/author/shaurya-malwa)\n\n[iframe](https://consentcdn.cookiebot.com/sdk/bc-v4.min.html)",
