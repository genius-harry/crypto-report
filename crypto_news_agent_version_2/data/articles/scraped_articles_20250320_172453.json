[Ethereum](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-ethereum-quickly-explained-four-minute-guide), and [Solana](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-solana-a-scalable-decentralized-network-for-dapps) are up—along with U.S. equities—after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday [held interest rates steady](https://decrypt.co/310718/bitcoin-wavers-as-fed-holds-rates-steady) and the central bank's chair gave a calming press conference.\n\nThe biggest cryptocurrency had jumped before the Fed's announcement, but is now up even more: [Bitcoin's price](https://decrypt.co/price/bitcoin) now stands at $85,648, a more than 4% rise over the past day. The price rose as high as $85,890, marking the highest level since March 9.\n\nThe [price of Ethereum](https://decrypt.co/price/ethereum) is up even more: the second biggest virtual coin is up more than 7% over the same period, with a current price of $2,038.\n\nAnd Solana is [currently trading hands](https://decrypt.co/price/solana) for nearly $134, climbing by 8% over a 24-hour period; the coin, which is the sixthbiggest digital asset, jumped by 2% in the hour after Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke.\n\nThe wider crypto market is now up by more than 3% over the past day, and its total market cap stands at $2.91 trillion.\n\n![The Federal Reserve Building in Washington DC.

The $80,000 mark remains one to be watched, some say, as a break below would mean a critical support level vanishes.\n\nThe widely-watched ETH/BTC ratio - or the trading pair of ether against bitcoin - rose from 0.23 to 0.24 since Asian morning hours, indicative of a bump in demand for riskier ETH versus the perceived safety of bitcoin.\n\nEther rose on no immediate catalyst, but the mothership network has technical catalysts in the making. The Pectra upgrade, Ethereum's next major update, is currently in testing and aims to improve scalability, staking, and user experience with over 20 EIPs, including EIP-7702 (smart account functionality) and EIP-7251 (raising validator staking limits to 2,048 ETH).\n\nTesting began on Holesky in February 2025, followed by Sepolia in March, but faced challenges like transaction processing issues due to client incompatibilities. A new testnet, Hooli, launched on March 17, with Pectra testing scheduled for March 26. If successful, mainnet deployment is expected in late April or early May 2025.\n\n“BTC has found some support at the $80K, but that seems tenuous at best amid broader macro weakness,” traders at Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a broadcast message. “We won’t attempt to call the exact moment when the music stops, but in the short term, we struggle to identify meaningful tailwinds to reverse this rout.”\n\n“We will be watching closely for any dovish shifts, particularly on growth and inflation expectations. Given that it will take months for the impact of tariffs to ripple through the economy, we expect the Fed to remain in “wait-and-see” mode,” QCP added.\n\nMeanwhile, gold broke above $3,000 to new highs earlier Wednesday, leading to some eyeing an inverse correlation of the yellow metal with bitcoin.\n\n“Despite its historical correlation with gold as a macro hedge, Bitcoin's current divergence—falling while gold rises—suggests it's acting more like a risk asset, influenced by Fed policy uncertainty, profit-taking, and a shift to traditional safe-havens,” Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.\n\n“The FOMC outcome could either trigger a recovery if dovish or deepen the correction if hawkish, with bitcoin's short-term trajectory tied to broader economic signals rather than solely reinforcing its \"digital gold\" role,” Lee added.\n\n[Ether](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/ether) [Bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/bitcoin) [FOMC](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/fomc)\n\n##### [Shaurya Malwa](https://www.coindesk.com/author/shaurya-malwa)\n\nShaurya is the Co-Leader of the CoinDesk tokens and data team in Asia with a focus on crypto derivatives, DeFi, market microstructure, and protocol analysis.\n\nShaurya holds over $1,000 in BTC, ETH, SOL, AVAX, SUSHI, CRV, NEAR, YFI, YFII, SHIB, DOGE, USDT, USDC, BNB, MANA, MLN, LINK, XMR, ALGO, VET, CAKE, AAVE, COMP, ROOK, TRX, SNX, RUNE, FTM, ZIL, KSM, ENJ, CKB, JOE, GHST, PERP, BTRFLY, OHM, BANANA, ROME, BURGER, SPIRIT, and ORCA.\n\nHe provides over $1,000 to liquidity pools on Compound, Curve, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, BurgerSwap, Orca, AnySwap, SpiritSwap, Rook Protocol, Yearn Finance, Synthetix, Harvest, Redacted Cartel, OlympusDAO, Rome, Trader Joe, and SUN.\n\n[X icon](https://x.com/shauryamalwa \"X\") [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaurya-malwa-a78101102/ \"LinkedIn\") [Email](mailto:shaurya.malwa@coindesk.com \"Email\")\n\n[![Shaurya Malwa](https://www.coindesk.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2F1c7e071b6b9ef4d849b5edaa9d644a67043efe54-512x512.png%3Fw%3D64%26h%3D64%26fit%3Dcrop%26crop%3Dfocalpoint%26auto%3Dformat&w=1080&q=75)](https://www.coindesk.com/author/shaurya-malwa)\n\n[iframe](https://consentcdn.cookiebot.com/sdk/bc-v4.min.html)",

Three of the most-watched (and most valuable) tokens today are **Bitcoin**(CRYPTO: BTC), **Ethereum**(CRYPTO: ETH) and **Dogecoin**(CRYPTO: DOGE). These digital assets have lost 2.9%, 2.8%, and 5.7%, respectively, over the past 24 hours as of 3 p.m. ET.\n\nThese moves have coincided with a broader pause in other risk assets ahead of what should be a very influential Federal Reserve decision tomorrow. But as is always the case with these high-flying assets, there's more to the story.\n\nLet's dive into some of the key drivers affecting demand for these three top cryptos today.\n\n## ETF flows generating outsized attention\n\nFollowing the post-Trump election victory, which saw Bitcoin rise to new all-time highs, and other top tokens like Ethereum and Dogecoin also see their fair share of upside, the performance of these top three cryptocurrencies has been overtly negative since Inauguration Day.\n\nSome of this depressed sentiment can be tied to spot ETF inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum. Among the notable reports I've seen come through is one detailing the surge of capital into gold-denominated ETFs and assets, with ETF outflows from various Bitcoin ETFs presumably flowing into these safe-haven funds.\n\nOne of the key investing theses held by long-term Bitcoin bulls (and to a certain extent, Ethereum holders as well) is that these digital assets carry some \"store of value\" properties that should provide demand even in the worst market environments. In fairness, we've yet to see how any cryptocurrency performs in a prolonged bear market (Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency, created in 2009 following the GFC).\n\nThat said, the fact that spot Bitcoin ETFs have given up their lead over gold ETFs (which was first gained late last year following the Trump election victory) is a trend worth noting. If more capital continues to flow out of this space, spot Ethereum ETFs (and future potential spot ETFs for Dogecoin and other assets) may have a much more negative outlook. Indeed, the recent news that two Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs are being liquidated by 21Shares adds to this narrative.\n\n## What to make of these recession concerns?\n\nI think the price action of all three major tokens today, and for the better part of the past two months, is really indicative of how investors view cryptocurrencies as an asset class in a potential recession. Right now, market participants are increasingly attempting to price new recession probabilities into their models. For top cryptos like these, their performance in a protracted downturn is really not known. That's adding to the uncertainty around owning these assets heading into what could be a turbulent back half of 2025.\n\nStory Continues\n\nI think Bitcoin and Ethereum should have plenty of long-term upside. But I'm also aware that these assets have posted multiple 50%-plus drawdowns in the past, on lesser news than concerns around a potential recession. So investors will have to hone in on their investing timeline and what sort of levels they'd consider buying these assets at first before jumping in with both feet.\n\nMy view of Dogecoin is that this meme token is more of a speculative tool for traders to play sentiment to the upside and downside. Today's outsized move lower is indicative of how this token trades (with plenty of leveraged derivatives positions in the background driving these volatile moves).\n\nIf you're of the mind that more downside is likely, buying the dip with the world's two most valuable cryptocurrencies may be the strategy of choice.\n\n## Should you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe _Motley Fool Stock Advisor_ analyst team just identified what they believe are the **[10 best stocks](https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&impression=55981e0d-3c7f-484c-855e-85f65022d943&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-sa-bbn-bn%3Faid%3D8867%26source%3Disaeditxt0001029%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Darticle_pitch_feed_yahoo%26ftm_pit%3D17177&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=9c34ac48-04cc-48dc-af8d-993ede4c9e44)** for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

Three of the most-watched (and most valuable) tokens today are **Bitcoin**(CRYPTO: BTC), **Ethereum**(CRYPTO: ETH) and **Dogecoin**(CRYPTO: DOGE). These digital assets have lost 2.9%, 2.8%, and 5.7%, respectively, over the past 24 hours as of 3 p.m. ET.\n\nThese moves have coincided with a broader pause in other risk assets ahead of what should be a very influential Federal Reserve decision tomorrow. But as is always the case with these high-flying assets, there's more to the story.\n\nLet's dive into some of the key drivers affecting demand for these three top cryptos today.\n\n## ETF flows generating outsized attention\n\nFollowing the post-Trump election victory, which saw Bitcoin rise to new all-time highs, and other top tokens like Ethereum and Dogecoin also see their fair share of upside, the performance of these top three cryptocurrencies has been overtly negative since Inauguration Day.\n\nSome of this depressed sentiment can be tied to spot ETF inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum. Among the notable reports I've seen come through is one detailing the surge of capital into gold-denominated ETFs and assets, with ETF outflows from various Bitcoin ETFs presumably flowing into these safe-haven funds.\n\nOne of the key investing theses held by long-term Bitcoin bulls (and to a certain extent, Ethereum holders as well) is that these digital assets carry some \"store of value\" properties that should provide demand even in the worst market environments. In fairness, we've yet to see how any cryptocurrency performs in a prolonged bear market (Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency, created in 2009 following the GFC).\n\nThat said, the fact that spot Bitcoin ETFs have given up their lead over gold ETFs (which was first gained late last year following the Trump election victory) is a trend worth noting. If more capital continues to flow out of this space, spot Ethereum ETFs (and future potential spot ETFs for Dogecoin and other assets) may have a much more negative outlook. Indeed, the recent news that two Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs are being liquidated by 21Shares adds to this narrative.\n\n## What to make of these recession concerns?\n\nI think the price action of all three major tokens today, and for the better part of the past two months, is really indicative of how investors view cryptocurrencies as an asset class in a potential recession. Right now, market participants are increasingly attempting to price new recession probabilities into their models. For top cryptos like these, their performance in a protracted downturn is really not known. That's adding to the uncertainty around owning these assets heading into what could be a turbulent back half of 2025.\n\nStory Continues\n\nI think Bitcoin and Ethereum should have plenty of long-term upside.

Three of the most-watched (and most valuable) tokens today are **Bitcoin**( [BTC](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/btc/) 3.05%), **Ethereum**( [ETH](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/eth/) 3.68%) and **Dogecoin**( [DOGE](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/doge/) 4.18%). These digital assets have lost 2.9%, 2.8%, and 5.7%, respectively, over the past 24 hours as of 3 p.m. ET.\n\nThese moves have coincided with a broader pause in other risk assets ahead of what should be a very influential Federal Reserve decision tomorrow. But as is always the case with these high-flying assets, there's more to the story.\n\nLet's dive into some of the key drivers affecting demand for these three top cryptos today.\n\n## ETF flows generating outsized attention\n\nFollowing the post-Trump election victory, which saw Bitcoin rise to new all-time highs, and other top tokens like Ethereum and Dogecoin also see their fair share of upside, the performance of these top three cryptocurrencies has been overtly negative since Inauguration Day.\n\nSome of this depressed sentiment can be tied to spot ETF inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum. Among the notable reports I've seen come through is one detailing the surge of capital into gold-denominated ETFs and assets, with ETF outflows from various Bitcoin ETFs presumably flowing into these safe-haven funds.\n\nOne of the key investing theses held by long-term Bitcoin bulls (and to a certain extent, Ethereum holders as well) is that these digital assets carry some \"store of value\" properties that should provide demand even in the worst market environments. In fairness, we've yet to see how any cryptocurrency performs in a prolonged bear market (Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency, created in 2009 following the GFC).\n\nThat said, the fact that spot Bitcoin ETFs have given up their lead over gold ETFs (which was first gained late last year following the Trump election victory) is a trend worth noting. If more capital continues to flow out of this space, spot Ethereum ETFs (and future potential spot ETFs for Dogecoin and other assets) may have a much more negative outlook. Indeed, the recent news that two Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs are being liquidated by 21Shares adds to this narrative.\n\n## What to make of these recession concerns?\n\nI think the price action of all three major tokens today, and for the better part of the past two months, is really indicative of how investors view cryptocurrencies as an asset class in a potential recession. Right now, market participants are increasingly attempting to price new recession probabilities into their models. For top cryptos like these, their performance in a protracted downturn is really not known. That's adding to the uncertainty around owning these assets heading into what could be a turbulent back half of 2025.\n\nI think Bitcoin and Ethereum should have plenty of long-term upside. But I'm also aware that these assets have posted multiple 50%-plus drawdowns in the past, on lesser news than concerns around a potential recession. So investors will have to hone in on their investing timeline and what sort of levels they'd consider buying these assets at first before jumping in with both feet.\n\nMy view of Dogecoin is that this meme token is more of a speculative tool for traders to play sentiment to the upside and downside. Today's outsized move lower is indicative of how this token trades (with plenty of leveraged derivatives positions in the background driving these volatile moves).\n\nIf you're of the mind that more downside is likely, buying the dip with the world's two most valuable cryptocurrencies may be the strategy of choice.\n\n_[Chris MacDonald](https://www.fool.com/author/20447/) has positions in Ethereum.

This level roughly coincides with the daily resistance level at $85,000, making it a key resistance zone. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it trades around $82,600.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator suggests a strength in momentum on the daily chart. The lower low in the [Bitcoin](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin) price formed on March 11 does not reflect the RSI higher high for the same period. This development is termed a bullish divergence, often leading to a trend reversal or short-term rally.\n\nIf bullish divergence plays a part and BTC closes above its 200-day EMA at $85,496, it could extend the recovery to $90,000.\n\n![BTC/USDT daily chart](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/BTCUSDT_2025-03-19_07-31-37-638779502549626319.png)\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart\n\nHowever, if BTC corrects and closes below $78,258 (February 28 low), it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $73,072.\n\n## **Ethereum could recover if its $1,861 level continues to hold as support**\n\nEthereum price was retested, and support was found around its daily level at $1,861 since last week. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it is trading slightly above $1,930.\n\nIf the daily support around $1,861 holds, the ETH price could extend the recovery to retest its March 7 high of $2,258.\n\nThe RSI on the daily chart reads 36 after bouncing off its oversold level of 30 last week, indicating fading bearish momentum. However, the RSI must move above its neutral level of 50 for the recovery rally to be sustained.\n\n![ETH/USDT daily chart](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/ETHUSDT_2025-03-19_08-02-34-638779502943417861.png)\n\nETH/USDT daily chart\n\nOn the other hand, if ETH breaks and closes below the daily support at $1,861, it could extend the decline to retest the next support level at $1,700.\n\n## **XRP momentum indicator displays indecisiveness among the traders**\n\nRipple price retested its daily support of $1.96 on March 11 and recovered 10.14% in the next 4 days. However, it faced resistance around the 50-day EMA at around the $2.50 level on Saturday, declining 4.38% until Tuesday. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it trades at around $2.27.\n\nIf XRP breaks and closes above the 50-day EMA at $2.50, it could extend the recovery to retest its $2.72 level.\n\nThe RSI on the daily [chart](https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart) reads 46, hovering around the neutral level of 50, indicating indecisiveness among the traders. For the bullish momentum to be sustained, the RSI must move above its neutral level of 50\n\n![XRP/USDT daily chart](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/XRPUSDT_2025-03-19_08-09-53-638779503329467111.png)\n\nXRP/USDT daily chart\n\nHowever, if XRP faces a correction and closes below $1.96 daily support, it could extend an additional decline to test its February 3 low of $1.77.\n\n## Bitcoin, altcoins, stablecoins FAQs\n\n### What is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.\n\n### What are altcoins?\n\nAltcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.\n\n### What are stablecoins?\n\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.\n\n### What is Bitcoin Dominance?\n\nBitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin’s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.\n\n* * *\n\nShare: [Cryptos feed](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/feed)\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.\n\n### What are altcoins?\n\nAltcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.\n\n### What are stablecoins?\n\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.\n\n### What is Bitcoin Dominance?\n\nBitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin’s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.\n\n* * *\n\nShare: [Cryptos feed](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/feed)\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

However, stablecoins like **USDC** have seen remarkable inflows of capital. The coins, which are fixed in value, are growing in popularity as a sort of digital cash. Most stablecoins exist on a parent blockchain and Ethereum dominates the space. It was reported yesterday that Ethereum's four-month average trading volume for these stablecoins reached $850 billion. The continued dominance shows Ethereum is still holding its lead as the preferred \"smart contract\" blockchain as others have proliferated.\n\nArrows-OutExpand\n\n![](https://g.foolcdn.com/art/companylogos/mark/ETH.png)\n\n## [CRYPTO: ETH](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/eth/)\n\nEthereum\n\nToday's Change\n\n(3.86%) $74.92\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$2,017.69\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nYTD1w1m3m6m\n1y\n\n\n -41.38%\n\n\n5y\n\nPrice\n\nVS S&P\n\n\nETH\n\n\n### Key Data Points\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$243B\n\nDay's Range\n\n$1,940.35 - $2,067.11\n\n52wk Range\n\n$1,791.23 - $4,089.23\n\nVolume\n\n21,745,106,705\n\nAvg Vol\n\nGross Margin\n\n0.00%\n\nDividend Yield\n\nN/A\n\n## Dogecoin's new sponsorship\n\nThe House of Doge and Dogecoin Foundation, organizations that support and promote the cryptocurrency and meme coin, announced a new partnership today. The two are teaming up with IndyCar driver Devlin DeFrancesco and Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing to bring Dogecoin to the 109th running of the Indianapolis 500.\n\nThe Dogecoin Racing initiative will let fans vote on DeFrancesco's car design for the May 25 race, so long as the iconic Shiba Inu dog is at the center of the design. The partnership will also include a donation platform supporting a cause important to the team.\n\nThe Indianapolis 500 draws over 350,000 in-person spectators and many more around the world. Investors see this as an opportunity to boost Dogecoin's profile.\n\nArrows-OutExpand\n\n![](https://g.foolcdn.com/art/companylogos/mark/DOGE.png)\n\n## [CRYPTO: DOGE](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/doge/)\n\nDogecoin\n\nToday's Change\n\n(4.18%) $0.01\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$0.17\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nYTD1w\n1m\n\n\n -34.80%\n\n\n3m6m1y5y\n\nPrice\n\nVS S&P\n\n\nDOGE\n\n\n### Key Data Points\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$26B\n\nDay's Range\n\n$0.17 - $0.18\n\n52wk Range\n\n$0.08 - $0.48\n\nVolume\n\n1,457,880,392\n\nAvg Vol\n\nGross Margin\n\n0.00%\n\nDividend Yield\n\nN/A\n\n## Macro trends don't look great\n\nThe Federal Reserve announced today that there were no changes to the current interest rate plan. The reserve is still projecting modest GDP growth and relatively mild inflation, so fears of a recession or \"stagflation\" -- little to no GDP growth with high inflation -- were not echoed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. That's good news for now.\n\nHowever, Powell has indicated that the current environment makes predicting the future particularly difficult. There is a lot of uncertainty in the market at the moment. So, while recent developments helped boost the big three cryptocurrencies, they are still volatile assets, especially Dogecoin, a meme coin. They are highly sensitive to broader economic conditions and rising uncertainty. A looser regulatory environment could be offset by the uncertainty Trump's trade tariffs and foreign policy bring.\n\n_[Johnny Rice](https://www.fool.com/author/20621/) has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The **S&P 500** is up 0.8% and the **Nasdaq Composite** is up 1.1%.\n\nAll three cryptocurrencies got a boost from news that the SEC's appeal in its case against **XRP** would be dropped, a major step that confirms the Trump administration's softer approach to crypto regulation, boosting the whole market.\n\n## SEC backs off\n\n[Ripple, the company behind XRP](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/03/06/should-you-buy-xrp-while-its-under-250/), announced that the SEC is abandoning its appeal in the long-running legal battle against the company. The case dates back to 2020 when the SEC sued Ripple for allegedly selling unregistered securities. Ripple scored a partial victory last year when a judge ruled XRP wasn't a security when sold to retail investors -- though institutional sales were different. The SEC appealed this decision, but now, after a change in leadership, the regulator is dropping its appeal.\n\nThis development comes amid a sweeping reversal of the previous administration's crypto crackdown. The SEC recently ended its **Coinbase Global** case, closed investigations into several crypto companies, scaled back enforcement, and declared [meme coins](https://www.fool.com/terms/m/meme-coin/) aren't securities.

Unlike previous bear markets, traders are seeing shorter bear cycles followed by sharp price rallies.\n\nThe upcoming FOMC meeting could usher higher volatility in the prices of top three cryptocurrencies and present buy the dip opportunities or offer opportunities for traders to take profits, amidst the prolonged bear market.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n## Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP trader sentiment turn risk-off\n\nBitcoin , Ethereum  and XRP  traders have reduced their activity in the derivatives market in the past 24 hours. Derivatives data from Coinglass shows a decline in trade volume, BTC and ETH trade volume declined nearly 11% and 7%. XRP noted a nearly 14% decline in trade volume in the same timeframe.\n\nCoinglass shows that traders have turned risk-averse following nearly $89 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours in the top three cryptocurrencies.\n\n![Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP](https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-19-at-3.25.51%E2%80%AFPM.png)Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP derivatives data \\| Source: [Coinglass](https://www.coinglass.com/)\n\nOpen Interest, another key derivatives metric, the combined value of all open contracts in a given token climbed by 1.42%, 4.90% and 1.49% respectively for the top three cryptos BTC, ETH and XRP.\n\n## BTC, ETH, XRP on-chain analysis\n\nOn-chain analysis for the top three cryptocurrencies on Santiment shows that Binance funding rate for Bitcoin has been positive for three consecutive days in a row. Meaning Bitcoin derivatives traders expect price to appreciate, even as they reduce their activity in the token, as gathered by Coinglass data.\n\nEthereum supply held by whales, excluding exchanges, sees no significant change, while Bitcoin supply held by funds has reduced consistently. The active addresses in XRP, on the daily timeframe have climbed on Wednesday, after a negative spike on Tuesday, as noted by Santiment.\n\nThe mixed on-chain data suggests a slightly bullish outlook for Bitcoin and XRP and Ethereum price could remain stable or unchanged in the face of upcoming volatility in the prices of the top three cryptocurrencies with the looming FOMC interest rate decision.\n\n![Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP](https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2025/03/Bitcoin-BTC-15.35.01-19-Mar-2025.png)Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP on-chain analysis \\| Source: [Santiment](https://app.santiment.net/charts/cdySJuvR__sCl)\n\nOn the Bitcoin blockchain, the ratio of daily on-chain transactions in profits is nearly double that of transactions in losses, there is scope for profit-taking by traders who bought the token lower. In the case of Ethereum, there is a slight uptick in the supply in profit and the same has been observed in XRP.\n\nEthereum and XRP both offer limited profit-taking opportunities for traders, as seen in the chart below.\n\n![Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP](https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2025/03/Bitcoin-BTC-15.38.03-19-Mar-2025.png)Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP on-chain analysis \\| Source: [Santiment](https://app.santiment.net/charts/cdySJuvR__sCl)\n\nYou might also like:\n[Why did South Korea reject a Bitcoin reserve? How do other countries explain the reluctance to adopt the BTC reserve?](https://crypto.news/why-did-south-korea-reject-a-bitcoin-reserve/)\n\n## Trump push and FOMC rate decision\n\nBitget CEO Gracy Chen told Crypto.news that Trump’s pro-crypto stance has left many traders puzzled. The idea of a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve is gaining traction and while the government is not buying Bitcoin yet, it could soon change.\n\n> “The Stablecoin bill is moving through Congress, signaling a major shift toward a blockchain-based financial system. Some big names, Elon Musk included, are exploring their own stablecoins, and Trump’s team sees stablecoins as a way to protect the dollar’s global reserve status.\n>\n> Then there’s the economy. Scott Bessent’s talk of a “detox period” suggests a controlled downturn might be ahead. If that’s the case, Trump’s playbook seems clear: blame the recession on Biden, use tariffs and crypto narratives to manage costs, and push for lower interest rates to fuel tech and AI growth. Short-term pain, long-term gain — that’s the strategy.”\n\nChen maintains an optimistic outlook on Bitcoin and predicts no fall under $70,000.\n\n> “Bitcoin price drop to possibly 73-78k \\[is likely\\], which is a solid time to enter for any buyers on the fence. In the next 1-2 years, BTC at 200k isn’t as far-fetched as most would think.”\n\nThe FOMC interest rate decision is looming, with the likelihood of higher volatility and price swings as traders react to the news.\n\nRyan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research told Crypto.news in a written note:\n\n> “The FOMC meeting on March 19, 2025, is expected to maintain the federal funds rate at 4.25%-4.50%, with the Fed taking a cautious, data-driven approach amid persistent inflation and solid economic growth.\n>\n> Crypto markets could see a short-term rally if the Fed signals future rate cuts, boosting risk appetite, or a dip if a hawkish stance reinforces tighter financial conditions. However, Bitcoin’s growing resilience and pro-crypto policy tailwinds might temper the broader market impact.”\n\nLee believes that volatility is likely around the announcement, it could be driven by Federal Reserve chair Powell’s remarks and updated rate projections.\n\n> “The crypto market may continue showing increasing independence from Fed decisions. Post-FOMC, Bitcoin is expected to trade within $80,000–$86,000 with 80% confidence, while Ethereum is projected to move between $1,800–$2,100 under the same confidence level. These ranges reflect potential fluctuations tied to macroeconomic signals, investor sentiment, and broader financial conditions.”\n\nYou might also like:\n[Nansen: Whales quietly buy Ethereum as prices stagnate](https://crypto.news/nansen-whales-quietly-buy-ethereum-as-prices-stagnate/)\n\n## Bitcoin eyes return to $87,000, Ethereum could climb to $2,100\n\nBitcoin could return to the $87,000 level as BTC shows signs of recovery on Wednesday.

In the next 1-2 years, BTC at 200k isn’t as far-fetched as most would think.”\n\nThe FOMC interest rate decision is looming, with the likelihood of higher volatility and price swings as traders react to the news.\n\nRyan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research told Crypto.news in a written note:\n\n> “The FOMC meeting on March 19, 2025, is expected to maintain the federal funds rate at 4.25%-4.50%, with the Fed taking a cautious, data-driven approach amid persistent inflation and solid economic growth.\n>\n> Crypto markets could see a short-term rally if the Fed signals future rate cuts, boosting risk appetite, or a dip if a hawkish stance reinforces tighter financial conditions. However, Bitcoin’s growing resilience and pro-crypto policy tailwinds might temper the broader market impact.”\n\nLee believes that volatility is likely around the announcement, it could be driven by Federal Reserve chair Powell’s remarks and updated rate projections.\n\n> “The crypto market may continue showing increasing independence from Fed decisions. Post-FOMC, Bitcoin is expected to trade within $80,000–$86,000 with 80% confidence, while Ethereum is projected to move between $1,800–$2,100 under the same confidence level.

Should You?\nBy\nAlex Carchidi\n–\n  \n    \n      Mar 18, 2025 at 9:11PM\nKey Points\nAll sorts of investors own Bitcoin and Ethereum nowadays.\nSome of those investors are using them to do less-than-legal things.\nOne unsavory trade in particular is happening in high volume now.\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now ›\nCRYPTO: BTC\nBitcoin\nMarket Cap\n$1.7T\nToday's Change\nArrow-Thin-Down\n(3.05%) $2,548.31\nCurrent Price\n$86,052.00\nPrice as of March 20, 2025, 5:20 a.m. ET\nYou should make your investment decisions on your own, without directly worrying too much about the actions of other investors. But sometimes, certain gargantuan investors, or groups of them, can bring so much capital to bear that their behavior is worth understanding in detail -- especially when they're accumulating relatively volatile assets like\nBitcoin\n(\nBTC\n3.05%\n)\nand\nEthereum\n(\nETH\n3.68%\n)\n.\nThere's one particular and relatively new pattern of behavior among a group of major investors that's important to know about. It might not push the prices of these coins up indefinitely, but it's already having an effect.\nGeopolitics are now undeniably a big part of crypto markets\nBitcoin and Ethereum are assets with a global distribution. That means that in most major economies, people and businesses buy, hold, and sell them, even if it isn't fully legal to do so. In many major countries, cryptocurrency exchanges are operating legally as well. But even fully legal exchanges within well-defined regulatory regimes can be used for illegal or otherwise less-than-wholesome purposes, like dodging international sanctions or\nmoney laundering\n.\nRussia extracts, refines, and sells a lot of oil. In terms of dollars, Russia's oil trade was worth $192 billion in 2024; the country's native currency is the ruble. Much of that trade is oil sales to India, which uses the rupee as its currency, and China, which uses the yuan. But due to international sanctions on Russia stemming from its war against Ukraine, selling oil in exchange for rupees or yuan directly is not as easy as it used to be, as it'd entail violating sanctions.\nSo now, per Reuters reporting in mid-March, Russian oil businesses are using Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies to facilitate their payments and evade the barriers to trade posed by the sanctions.\nTo illustrate how this process works, let's say that a company in India wants to buy oil from Russia. First, the company pays a sketchy middleman, typically a shell company, in rupees. Then, that middleman exchanges the rupees for Bitcoin, Ethereum, or a\nstablecoin\n. This is an action that is not in and of itself in violation of any sanctions, so it isn't inhibited in any way at the point of the exchange. Next, the cryptocurrency is sent to the Russian business selling oil. That business then sells its crypto to convert it into rubles.\nThe payment is cleared, and the oil is transferred accordingly, effectively skirting the sanctions. One Russian crypto exchange faced sanctions from the U.S. and European Union for facilitating this type of workaround in 2022. This ultimately led to it shutting down in early March of this year after some of its stablecoin\nwallet addresses\nwere blocked by the coin's issuer. However, it's very likely that other exchanges are still in operation, and that more can spring up to take the fallen one's place.\nTherefore, investors should calculate that the sanctions evasion trade is more likely to continue using Bitcoin and Ethereum than it is with stablecoins moving forward. This will create buying pressure for those two coins for as long as the sanctions last, and perhaps even beyond that.\nThe force of that pressure may be substantial, depending on future demand for Russian oil.\nThis could unravel explosively\nCryptocurrency's legal status in Russia is shifting in real time. Its central bank just implemented a three-year pilot program enabling wealthy investors to trade cryptos and derivative financial instruments. The ongoing process is bound to have implications for how the country's domestic businesses can use Bitcoin and Ethereum to avoid sanctions.\nThus, most investors shouldn't commit to buying significant quantities of Bitcoin and Ethereum based solely on the evasion trade. It's unclear how long Russia will be facing sanctions, so the buying pressure represented by its oil companies may taper off suddenly, causing prices to fall or be more volatile than usual. It's also unclear if there will be attempts at enforcing the sanctions, given the nature of the particular cryptos used.\nBut, like it or not, this saga supports one of the key pillars of Bitcoin's value, which is that it's a form of money that's not subject to the oversight of any one country in the way that\nfiat currencies\nare. If it were like fiat currencies and not independent of governments, there'd be a large probability of a central issuing authority blocking the wallet addresses of known sanctions evaders. The whole point of the Russian oil businesses using Bitcoin here is that there's not any authority to say they aren't allowed to do what they're doing. That confirmation of part of its\ninvestment thesis\ncould be seen as another reason to buy it, provided that the intention is to hold it for the long term.\nWith Ethereum, this new driver is less relevant, and less likely to be sustained. While purchasing from sanction-dodgers could still generate higher prices over the coming months and perhaps even years, the existence of a relatively altruistic senior leadership team in the form of the Ethereum Foundation suggests that there might be some effort to adapt the chain such that it can't be used for nefarious purposes.\nIf you buy it to capture value from the evasion trade, the upside could be very short-lived, with a painful correction on the other side.

Even small price fluctuations can trigger large liquidations, as seen in this case. Market analysts believe ETH’s next key level to watch is $1,800, which could serve as a strong support or another breaking point. With global economic uncertainty continuing and crypto markets already under pressure, traders are approaching investments cautiously. Whether ETH stabilizes or continues its decline will depend on both macroeconomic trends and internal developments within the Ethereum network. For now, the market remains unpredictable, and leveraged positions continue to carry significant risks. View Comments Terms and Privacy Policy Privacy Dashboard More Info Recommended Stories\n",

Binance’s billionaire founder, Changpeng Zhao, who served four months in prison after pleading guilty to violating anti-money-laundering requirements, has been pushing for the Trump administration to grant him a pardon, sources added.\nFollowing the report, Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance and its ex-CEO,\nstated in a post to X:\n“Sorry to disappoint. The WSJ article got the facts wrong. More than 20 people have told me they were asked by the WSJ (and another media), ‘Can you confirm that CZ made some deal for a pardon?’ They probably asked hundreds of people to have 20 people reach out to me. In essence, they tried hard to make a story to report. Fact: I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with … well, anyone. No felon would mind a pardon, especially being the only one in US history who was ever sentenced to prison for a single BSA charge. Feels like the article is motivated as an attack on the President and crypto, and the residual forces of the ‘war on crypto’ from the last administration are still at work. I am always happy to make crypto great everywhere, US and the rest of the world. It’s good to see that even WSJ thinks I should be pardoned.”\nCOINBASE SECURES REGISTRATION IN INDIA:\nCoinbase\n(COIN)\nannounced Tuesday it\nhas registered with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit\n, which marks a significant milestone in its international expansion strategy. The company plans to launch its initial retail services later this year, followed by additional investment and products in India thereafter. “We’re committed to building in markets that believe in the potential of crypto and onchain innovation,” said John O’Loghlen, Regional Managing Director for APAC at Coinbase. “India represents one of the most exciting market opportunities in the world today, and we’re proud to deepen our investment here in full compliance with local regulations.”\nStory Continues\nAdditionally on Tuesday, Mizuho lowered the firm’s price target on Coinbase\nto $217 from $280 and kept a Neutral rating\non the shares. The firm said that since its last model update on February 20, the price of\nbitcoin\nhas fallen from $98,000 to $79,000 and Coinbase shares are down 30%. While some multiple compression is warranted due to lower multiples across technology, the move in Coinbase shares is overdone, the analyst said. Mizuho believes the stock should trade closer to $217. While it sees some upside from here, it remains Neutral given the longer-term risk of pricing pressure from increased competition across the crypto trading space. Mizuho cited lower market multiples for the target cut.\nBIT DIGITAL REPORTS FY24 RESULTS:\nOn Friday, Bit Digital\n(BTBT)\nreported FY24\nearnings per share of 19c on revenue of $108.1M,\nwhich compared to a loss per share of (16c) on revenue of $44.9M last year. The company earned 949.9 bitcoins during 2024, a 37% decrease from the prior year, and treasury holdings of BTC and ETH were 741.9 and 27,623.2, respectively, with a fair market value of approximately $69.3M and $92.1M on December 31, respectively.\nThe company said, “2024 marked a pivotal shift for Bit Digital. Our business was historically driven by digital asset mining, but the successful launch and rapid expansion of our HPC business fundamentally reshaped our company. This evolution drove over 140% revenue growth, with these new business lines contributing nearly half of total revenue. A defining milestone in this transformation was our acquisition of Enovum Data Centers in October. More than just an infrastructure expansion, Enovum provided us with a proven team, operational expertise, and a scalable platform to develop and operate data centers. It also introduced colocation services as a new business line, further diversifying our revenue streams and strengthening our\nAI\ncompute capabilities. Bitcoin mining remained a key revenue contributor, generating $58.6M, a 32% increase year-over-year. However, as our HPC business scaled, mining’s share of total revenue declined to 54% in 2024, and further to 40% in Q424, compared to 98% in 2023. This shift underscores our strategic pivot toward infrastructure-driven revenue streams while maintaining disciplined mining operations.”\nANALYSTS UPDATES BITCOIN MINER MODELS:\nOn Thursday, JPMorgan downgraded Cipher Mining\n(\nCIFR) to\nNeutral from Overweight without a price target.\nThe firm updated bitcoin miner price targets and models to reflect the Q4 results and changes in bitcoin price and the network hash rate. The firm now sees less upside potential relative to peers for Cipher Mining shares. Cipher could sign a high performance compute deal at its Barber Lake site, which could drive upside, but deals can take up to nine months to negotiate and finalize, the analyst said.\nJPMorgan also lowered the firm’s price target on Mara Holdings\n(MARA)\nto\n$18 from $23 and kept a Neutral rating\non the shares as well as on CleanSpark\n(\nCLSK) to\n$12 from $17 and kept an Overweight rating\non the shares and on Riot Platforms\n(RIOT)\nto\n$13 from $16 and kept an Overweight rating\non the shares.\nAdditionally, the firm upgraded\nIREN\n(IREN)\nto\nOverweight from Neutral with a price target of $12, down from $15\n. JPMorgan named IREN its top pick citing the company’s “strong” mining operations and high performance computing “optionality.” The shares have “been overly punished” year-to-date, and offer 70% upside at current levels, which could prove conservative if IREN announces an HPC deal with a name-brand tenant, the analyst said.\nHIVE PRICE TARGET LOWERED:\nCantor Fitzgerald lowered the firm’s price target on\nHive\nDigital\n(HIVE)\non Tuesday\nto $8 from $11 and kept an Overweight rating\non the shares. Hive said it mined 89 bitcoin during the month of February, or 3.1 bitcoin per day, a decrease from 102 bitcoin mined in January, and its share of the overall bitcoin network decreased to 0.69% from 0.73% on a peak hash rate basis, the analyst said. Cantor continues to believe that current levels represent an attractive risk/reward, as the firm is confident in Hive’s ability to execute on its bitcoin mining and AI Cloud targets, which will represent 300% hash rate growth and $100M in annualized run-rate revenue in 2025, respectively.\nCRYPTO STOCK PLAYS:\nPublicly traded companies in the space include Bit Digital, Coinbase, Core Scientific\n(CORZ)\n, Greenidge Generation\n(GREE)\n, Mara Holdings, Strategy\n(MSTR)\n, Riot Platforms, Stronghold Digital Mining\n(SDIG)\nand TeraWulf\n(WULF)\n.\nPRICE ACTION:\nAs of time of writing, bitcoin dropped about 6% this week to $83,160 in U.S. dollars, according to CoinDesk.\nPublished first on\nTheFly\n– the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.\nTry Now>>\nSee today’s best-performing stocks on TipRanks >>\nRead More on COIN:\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

This decision drove Bitcoin's price above $94,000, while Ethereum and other major altcoins saw substantial gains followed by sharp declines, reaffirming the market's continued short-term turbulence.\nAs a result, analysts predict that the cryptocurrency market will continue to experience fluctuations. In such a scenario, holding spot positions alone may not be enough to generate short-term profits. Consequently,\n100x leverage futures trading\nhas become the preferred tool for experienced investors looking to maximize their returns from market volatility. To meet this growing demand,\nBexBack Exchange\nis offering unparalleled promotional incentives, including:\n100% Deposit Bonus\n– Double your funds instantly.\n$50 Welcome Bonus – Available for new users upon completing their first trade.\n100x Leverage on Crypto Trading – Maximize potential gains even in a volatile market.\nNo KYC Required – Start trading immediately without identity verification.\nWhat Is 100x Leverage and How Does It Work?\n100x leverage allows traders to open significantly larger positions with a small amount of capital.

      "markdown": "BexBack Launches Double Deposit Bonus, $50 Welcome Bonus and 100x Leverage Crypto Trading – No KYC March 18, 2025 10:00 ET | Source: Bexback co., LTD Bexback co., LTD SINGAPORE, March 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Following President Donald Trump's announcement to include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) in the newly established U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve , the cryptocurrency market has experienced significant volatility. This decision drove Bitcoin's price above $94,000, while Ethereum and other major altcoins saw substantial gains followed by sharp declines, reaffirming the market's continued short-term turbulence. As a result, analysts predict that the cryptocurrency market will continue to experience fluctuations. In such a scenario, holding spot positions alone may not be enough to generate short-term profits. Consequently, 100x leverage futures trading has become the preferred tool for experienced investors looking to maximize their returns from market volatility. To meet this growing demand, BexBack Exchange is offering unparalleled promotional incentives, including: 100% Deposit Bonus – Double your funds instantly. $50 Welcome Bonus – Available for new users upon completing their first trade. 100x Leverage on Crypto Trading – Maximize potential gains even in a volatile market. No KYC Required – Start trading immediately without identity verification. What Is 100x Leverage and How Does It Work? 100x leverage allows traders to open significantly larger positions with a small amount of capital. Here’s an example: Suppose Bitcoin is priced at $100,000, and a trader opens a 1 BTC long position using 100x leverage. The actual trading position would be equivalent to 100 BTC. If Bitcoin rises to $105,000, the profit calculation would be: (105,000 - 100,000) * 100 BTC / 100,000 = 5 BTC, resulting in a 500% return.
