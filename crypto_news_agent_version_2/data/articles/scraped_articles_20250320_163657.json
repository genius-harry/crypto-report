Other Ethereum-based memecoins pepe (PEPE) and mog (MOG), rose more than 5% — continuing to act as levered bets.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDon't miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Long & Short Newsletter today.

Tron’s TRX dipped after a surge 5% earlier in the day as memecoin trading picked up on the blockchain following a [no-fee update](https://www.coindesk.com/daybook-us/2025/03/19/crypto-daybook-americas-memecoins-take-off-on-tron-while-bitcoin-looks-to-fomc) in the Sunpump platform.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) rose 2% and remained steady under $84,000 in Asian evening hours ahead of the FOMC, where traders expect rates to be held steady. The $80,000 mark remains one to be watched, some say, as a break below would mean a critical support level vanishes.\n\nThe widely-watched ETH/BTC ratio - or the trading pair of ether against bitcoin - rose from 0.23 to 0.24 since Asian morning hours, indicative of a bump in demand for riskier ETH versus the perceived safety of bitcoin.\n\nEther rose on no immediate catalyst, but the mothership network has technical catalysts in the making. The Pectra upgrade, Ethereum's next major update, is currently in testing and aims to improve scalability, staking, and user experience with over 20 EIPs, including EIP-7702 (smart account functionality) and EIP-7251 (raising validator staking limits to 2,048 ETH).\n\nTesting began on Holesky in February 2025, followed by Sepolia in March, but faced challenges like transaction processing issues due to client incompatibilities. A new testnet, Hooli, launched on March 17, with Pectra testing scheduled for March 26.

This level roughly coincides with the daily resistance level at $85,000, making it a key resistance zone.

The lower low in the [Bitcoin](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin) price formed on March 11 does not reflect the RSI higher high for the same period. This development is termed a bullish divergence, often leading to a trend reversal or short-term rally.\n\nIf bullish divergence plays a part and BTC closes above its 200-day EMA at $85,496, it could extend the recovery to $90,000.\n\n![BTC/USDT daily chart](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/BTCUSDT_2025-03-19_07-31-37-638779502549626319.png)\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart\n\nHowever, if BTC corrects and closes below $78,258 (February 28 low), it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $73,072.\n\n## **Ethereum could recover if its $1,861 level continues to hold as support**\n\nEthereum price was retested, and support was found around its daily level at $1,861 since last week. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it is trading slightly above $1,930.\n\nIf the daily support around $1,861 holds, the ETH price could extend the recovery to retest its March 7 high of $2,258.\n\nThe RSI on the daily chart reads 36 after bouncing off its oversold level of 30 last week, indicating fading bearish momentum.

However, it faced resistance around the 50-day EMA at around the $2.50 level on Saturday, declining 4.38% until Tuesday. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it trades at around $2.27.\n\nIf XRP breaks and closes above the 50-day EMA at $2.50, it could extend the recovery to retest its $2.72 level.\n\nThe RSI on the daily [chart](https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart) reads 46, hovering around the neutral level of 50, indicating indecisiveness among the traders.

This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.\n\n### What are altcoins?\n\nAltcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.\n\n### What are stablecoins?\n\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.\n\n### What is Bitcoin Dominance?\n\nBitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin’s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.\n\n* * *\n\nShare:Share on WhatsAppShare on TelegramCopy to clipboardCopied\n\nLinkedin\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nReddit\n\n[Email](mailto:?body=Bitcoin%C2%A0%28BTC%29%C2%A0and%C2%A0Ripple%C2%A0%28XRP%29%C2%A0prices%C2%A0face%C2%A0resistance%C2%A0around%C2%A0their%C2%A0key%C2%A0levels%3B%C2%A0a%C2%A0firm%C2%A0close%C2%A0above%C2%A0indicates%C2%A0recovery%C2%A0on%C2%A0the%C2%A0cards%2C%C2%A0while%C2%A0Ethereum%C2%A0%28ETH%29%C2%A0price%C2%A0finds%C2%A0support%C2%A0at%C2%A0its%C2%A0critical%C2%A0level%2C%C2%A0suggesting%C2%A0a%C2%A0bounce%C2%A0ahead.%C2%A0%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fxstreet.com%2Fcryptocurrencies%2Fnews%2Ftop-3-price-prediction-bitcoin-ethereum-ripple-btc-eth-and-xrp-expect-volatility-around-the-fomc-meeting-202503190306&subject=Top%203%20Price%20Prediction%20Bitcoin,%20Ethereum,%20Ripple:%20BTC,%20ETH%20and%20XRP%20expect%20volatility%20around%20the%20FOMC%20meeting)\n[Cryptos feed](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/feed)\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.\n\n* * *\n\nShare:Share on WhatsAppShare on TelegramCopy to clipboardCopied\n\nLinkedin\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nReddit\n\n[Email](mailto:?body=Bitcoin%C2%A0%28BTC%29%C2%A0and%C2%A0Ripple%C2%A0%28XRP%29%C2%A0prices%C2%A0face%C2%A0resistance%C2%A0around%C2%A0their%C2%A0key%C2%A0levels%3B%C2%A0a%C2%A0firm%C2%A0close%C2%A0above%C2%A0indicates%C2%A0recovery%C2%A0on%C2%A0the%C2%A0cards%2C%C2%A0while%C2%A0Ethereum%C2%A0%28ETH%29%C2%A0price%C2%A0finds%C2%A0support%C2%A0at%C2%A0its%C2%A0critical%C2%A0level%2C%C2%A0suggesting%C2%A0a%C2%A0bounce%C2%A0ahead.%C2%A0%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fxstreet.com%2Fcryptocurrencies%2Fnews%2Ftop-3-price-prediction-bitcoin-ethereum-ripple-btc-eth-and-xrp-expect-volatility-around-the-fomc-meeting-202503190306&subject=Top%203%20Price%20Prediction%20Bitcoin,%20Ethereum,%20Ripple:%20BTC,%20ETH%20and%20XRP%20expect%20volatility%20around%20the%20FOMC%20meeting)\n[Cryptos feed](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/feed)\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

This level roughly coincides with the daily resistance level at $85,000, making it a key resistance zone. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it trades around $82,600.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator suggests a strength in momentum on the daily chart. The lower low in the [Bitcoin](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin) price formed on March 11 does not reflect the RSI higher high for the same period. This development is termed a bullish divergence, often leading to a trend reversal or short-term rally.\n\nIf bullish divergence plays a part and BTC closes above its 200-day EMA at $85,496, it could extend the recovery to $90,000.\n\n![BTC/USDT daily chart](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/BTCUSDT_2025-03-19_07-31-37-638779502549626319.png)\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart\n\nHowever, if BTC corrects and closes below $78,258 (February 28 low), it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $73,072.\n\n## **Ethereum could recover if its $1,861 level continues to hold as support**\n\nEthereum price was retested, and support was found around its daily level at $1,861 since last week. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it is trading slightly above $1,930.\n\nIf the daily support around $1,861 holds, the ETH price could extend the recovery to retest its March 7 high of $2,258.\n\nThe RSI on the daily chart reads 36 after bouncing off its oversold level of 30 last week, indicating fading bearish momentum. However, the RSI must move above its neutral level of 50 for the recovery rally to be sustained.\n\n![ETH/USDT daily chart](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/ETHUSDT_2025-03-19_08-02-34-638779502943417861.png)\n\nETH/USDT daily chart\n\nOn the other hand, if ETH breaks and closes below the daily support at $1,861, it could extend the decline to retest the next support level at $1,700.\n\n## **XRP momentum indicator displays indecisiveness among the traders**\n\nRipple price retested its daily support of $1.96 on March 11 and recovered 10.14% in the next 4 days. However, it faced resistance around the 50-day EMA at around the $2.50 level on Saturday, declining 4.38% until Tuesday. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it trades at around $2.27.\n\nIf XRP breaks and closes above the 50-day EMA at $2.50, it could extend the recovery to retest its $2.72 level.\n\nThe RSI on the daily [chart](https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart) reads 46, hovering around the neutral level of 50, indicating indecisiveness among the traders. For the bullish momentum to be sustained, the RSI must move above its neutral level of 50\n\n![XRP/USDT daily chart](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/XRPUSDT_2025-03-19_08-09-53-638779503329467111.png)\n\nXRP/USDT daily chart\n\nHowever, if XRP faces a correction and closes below $1.96 daily support, it could extend an additional decline to test its February 3 low of $1.77.\n\n## Bitcoin, altcoins, stablecoins FAQs\n\n### What is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.\n\n### What are altcoins?\n\nAltcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.\n\n### What are stablecoins?\n\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.\n\n### What is Bitcoin Dominance?\n\nBitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin’s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.\n\n* * *\n\nShare:Share on WhatsAppShare on TelegramCopy to clipboardCopied\n\nLinkedin\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nReddit\n\n[Email](mailto:?body=Bitcoin%C2%A0%28BTC%29%C2%A0and%C2%A0Ripple%C2%A0%28XRP%29%C2%A0prices%C2%A0face%C2%A0resistance%C2%A0around%C2%A0their%C2%A0key%C2%A0levels%3B%C2%A0a%C2%A0firm%C2%A0close%C2%A0above%C2%A0indicates%C2%A0recovery%C2%A0on%C2%A0the%C2%A0cards%2C%C2%A0while%C2%A0Ethereum%C2%A0%28ETH%29%C2%A0price%C2%A0finds%C2%A0support%C2%A0at%C2%A0its%C2%A0critical%C2%A0level%2C%C2%A0suggesting%C2%A0a%C2%A0bounce%C2%A0ahead.%C2%A0%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fxstreet.com%2Fcryptocurrencies%2Fnews%2Ftop-3-price-prediction-bitcoin-ethereum-ripple-btc-eth-and-xrp-expect-volatility-around-the-fomc-meeting-202503190306&subject=Top%203%20Price%20Prediction%20Bitcoin,%20Ethereum,%20Ripple:%20BTC,%20ETH%20and%20XRP%20expect%20volatility%20around%20the%20FOMC%20meeting)\n[Cryptos feed](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/feed)\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Three of the most-watched (and most valuable) tokens today are **Bitcoin**(CRYPTO: BTC), **Ethereum**(CRYPTO: ETH) and **Dogecoin**(CRYPTO: DOGE). These digital assets have lost 2.9%, 2.8%, and 5.7%, respectively, over the past 24 hours as of 3 p.m. ET.\n\nThese moves have coincided with a broader pause in other risk assets ahead of what should be a very influential Federal Reserve decision tomorrow. But as is always the case with these high-flying assets, there's more to the story.\n\nLet's dive into some of the key drivers affecting demand for these three top cryptos today.\n\n## ETF flows generating outsized attention\n\nFollowing the post-Trump election victory, which saw Bitcoin rise to new all-time highs, and other top tokens like Ethereum and Dogecoin also see their fair share of upside, the performance of these top three cryptocurrencies has been overtly negative since Inauguration Day.\n\nSome of this depressed sentiment can be tied to spot ETF inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum. Among the notable reports I've seen come through is one detailing the surge of capital into gold-denominated ETFs and assets, with ETF outflows from various Bitcoin ETFs presumably flowing into these safe-haven funds.\n\nOne of the key investing theses held by long-term Bitcoin bulls (and to a certain extent, Ethereum holders as well) is that these digital assets carry some \"store of value\" properties that should provide demand even in the worst market environments. In fairness, we've yet to see how any cryptocurrency performs in a prolonged bear market (Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency, created in 2009 following the GFC).\n\nThat said, the fact that spot Bitcoin ETFs have given up their lead over gold ETFs (which was first gained late last year following the Trump election victory) is a trend worth noting. If more capital continues to flow out of this space, spot Ethereum ETFs (and future potential spot ETFs for Dogecoin and other assets) may have a much more negative outlook. Indeed, the recent news that two Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs are being liquidated by 21Shares adds to this narrative.\n\n## What to make of these recession concerns?\n\nI think the price action of all three major tokens today, and for the better part of the past two months, is really indicative of how investors view cryptocurrencies as an asset class in a potential recession. Right now, market participants are increasingly attempting to price new recession probabilities into their models. For top cryptos like these, their performance in a protracted downturn is really not known. That's adding to the uncertainty around owning these assets heading into what could be a turbulent back half of 2025.\n\nStory Continues\n\nI think Bitcoin and Ethereum should have plenty of long-term upside. But I'm also aware that these assets have posted multiple 50%-plus drawdowns in the past, on lesser news than concerns around a potential recession. So investors will have to hone in on their investing timeline and what sort of levels they'd consider buying these assets at first before jumping in with both feet.\n\nMy view of Dogecoin is that this meme token is more of a speculative tool for traders to play sentiment to the upside and downside. Today's outsized move lower is indicative of how this token trades (with plenty of leveraged derivatives positions in the background driving these volatile moves).\n\nIf you're of the mind that more downside is likely, buying the dip with the world's two most valuable cryptocurrencies may be the strategy of choice.\n\n## Should you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe _Motley Fool Stock Advisor_ analyst team just identified what they believe are the **[10 best stocks](https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&impression=55981e0d-3c7f-484c-855e-85f65022d943&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-sa-bbn-bn%3Faid%3D8867%26source%3Disaeditxt0001029%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Darticle_pitch_feed_yahoo%26ftm_pit%3D17177&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=9c34ac48-04cc-48dc-af8d-993ede4c9e44)** for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

But as is always the case with these high-flying assets, there's more to the story.\n\nLet's dive into some of the key drivers affecting demand for these three top cryptos today.\n\n## ETF flows generating outsized attention\n\nFollowing the post-Trump election victory, which saw Bitcoin rise to new all-time highs, and other top tokens like Ethereum and Dogecoin also see their fair share of upside, the performance of these top three cryptocurrencies has been overtly negative since Inauguration Day.\n\nSome of this depressed sentiment can be tied to spot ETF inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum. Among the notable reports I've seen come through is one detailing the surge of capital into gold-denominated ETFs and assets, with ETF outflows from various Bitcoin ETFs presumably flowing into these safe-haven funds.\n\nOne of the key investing theses held by long-term Bitcoin bulls (and to a certain extent, Ethereum holders as well) is that these digital assets carry some \"store of value\" properties that should provide demand even in the worst market environments. In fairness, we've yet to see how any cryptocurrency performs in a prolonged bear market (Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency, created in 2009 following the GFC).\n\nThat said, the fact that spot Bitcoin ETFs have given up their lead over gold ETFs (which was first gained late last year following the Trump election victory) is a trend worth noting. If more capital continues to flow out of this space, spot Ethereum ETFs (and future potential spot ETFs for Dogecoin and other assets) may have a much more negative outlook. Indeed, the recent news that two Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs are being liquidated by 21Shares adds to this narrative.\n\n## What to make of these recession concerns?\n\nI think the price action of all three major tokens today, and for the better part of the past two months, is really indicative of how investors view cryptocurrencies as an asset class in a potential recession. Right now, market participants are increasingly attempting to price new recession probabilities into their models. For top cryptos like these, their performance in a protracted downturn is really not known. That's adding to the uncertainty around owning these assets heading into what could be a turbulent back half of 2025.\n\nI think Bitcoin and Ethereum should have plenty of long-term upside. But I'm also aware that these assets have posted multiple 50%-plus drawdowns in the past, on lesser news than concerns around a potential recession. So investors will have to hone in on their investing timeline and what sort of levels they'd consider buying these assets at first before jumping in with both feet.\n\nMy view of Dogecoin is that this meme token is more of a speculative tool for traders to play sentiment to the upside and downside. Today's outsized move lower is indicative of how this token trades (with plenty of leveraged derivatives positions in the background driving these volatile moves).\n\nIf you're of the mind that more downside is likely, buying the dip with the world's two most valuable cryptocurrencies may be the strategy of choice.\n\n_[Chris MacDonald](https://www.fool.com/author/20447/) has positions in Ethereum.

Three of the most-watched (and most valuable) tokens today are **Bitcoin**( [BTC](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/btc/) 2.95%), **Ethereum**( [ETH](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/eth/) 3.73%) and **Dogecoin**( [DOGE](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/doge/) 3.93%). These digital assets have lost 2.9%, 2.8%, and 5.7%, respectively, over the past 24 hours as of 3 p.m. ET.\n\nThese moves have coincided with a broader pause in other risk assets ahead of what should be a very influential Federal Reserve decision tomorrow. But as is always the case with these high-flying assets, there's more to the story.\n\nLet's dive into some of the key drivers affecting demand for these three top cryptos today.\n\n## ETF flows generating outsized attention\n\nFollowing the post-Trump election victory, which saw Bitcoin rise to new all-time highs, and other top tokens like Ethereum and Dogecoin also see their fair share of upside, the performance of these top three cryptocurrencies has been overtly negative since Inauguration Day.\n\nSome of this depressed sentiment can be tied to spot ETF inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum. Among the notable reports I've seen come through is one detailing the surge of capital into gold-denominated ETFs and assets, with ETF outflows from various Bitcoin ETFs presumably flowing into these safe-haven funds.\n\nOne of the key investing theses held by long-term Bitcoin bulls (and to a certain extent, Ethereum holders as well) is that these digital assets carry some \"store of value\" properties that should provide demand even in the worst market environments. In fairness, we've yet to see how any cryptocurrency performs in a prolonged bear market (Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency, created in 2009 following the GFC).\n\nThat said, the fact that spot Bitcoin ETFs have given up their lead over gold ETFs (which was first gained late last year following the Trump election victory) is a trend worth noting. If more capital continues to flow out of this space, spot Ethereum ETFs (and future potential spot ETFs for Dogecoin and other assets) may have a much more negative outlook. Indeed, the recent news that two Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs are being liquidated by 21Shares adds to this narrative.\n\n## What to make of these recession concerns?\n\nI think the price action of all three major tokens today, and for the better part of the past two months, is really indicative of how investors view cryptocurrencies as an asset class in a potential recession. Right now, market participants are increasingly attempting to price new recession probabilities into their models. For top cryptos like these, their performance in a protracted downturn is really not known. That's adding to the uncertainty around owning these assets heading into what could be a turbulent back half of 2025.\n\nI think Bitcoin and Ethereum should have plenty of long-term upside. But I'm also aware that these assets have posted multiple 50%-plus drawdowns in the past, on lesser news than concerns around a potential recession. So investors will have to hone in on their investing timeline and what sort of levels they'd consider buying these assets at first before jumping in with both feet.\n\nMy view of Dogecoin is that this meme token is more of a speculative tool for traders to play sentiment to the upside and downside. Today's outsized move lower is indicative of how this token trades (with plenty of leveraged derivatives positions in the background driving these volatile moves).\n\nIf you're of the mind that more downside is likely, buying the dip with the world's two most valuable cryptocurrencies may be the strategy of choice.\n\n_[Chris MacDonald](https://www.fool.com/author/20447/) has positions in Ethereum.

The **S&P 500** is up 0.8% and the **Nasdaq Composite** is up 1.1%.\n\nAll three cryptocurrencies got a boost from news that the SEC's appeal in its case against **XRP** would be dropped, a major step that confirms the Trump administration's softer approach to crypto regulation, boosting the whole market.\n\n## SEC backs off\n\n[Ripple, the company behind XRP](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/03/06/should-you-buy-xrp-while-its-under-250/), announced that the SEC is abandoning its appeal in the long-running legal battle against the company. The case dates back to 2020 when the SEC sued Ripple for allegedly selling unregistered securities. Ripple scored a partial victory last year when a judge ruled XRP wasn't a security when sold to retail investors -- though institutional sales were different. The SEC appealed this decision, but now, after a change in leadership, the regulator is dropping its appeal.\n\nThis development comes amid a sweeping reversal of the previous administration's crypto crackdown.

Most stablecoins exist on a parent blockchain and Ethereum dominates the space. It was reported yesterday that Ethereum's four-month average trading volume for these stablecoins reached $850 billion.

The partnership will also include a donation platform supporting a cause important to the team.\n\nThe Indianapolis 500 draws over 350,000 in-person spectators and many more around the world.

The reserve is still projecting modest GDP growth and relatively mild inflation, so fears of a recession or \"stagflation\" -- little to no GDP growth with high inflation -- were not echoed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. That's good news for now.\n\nHowever, Powell has indicated that the current environment makes predicting the future particularly difficult. There is a lot of uncertainty in the market at the moment. So, while recent developments helped boost the big three cryptocurrencies, they are still volatile assets, especially Dogecoin, a meme coin. They are highly sensitive to broader economic conditions and rising uncertainty. A looser regulatory environment could be offset by the uncertainty Trump's trade tariffs and foreign policy bring.\n\n_[Johnny Rice](https://www.fool.com/author/20621/) has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Earlier in the day, however, they were up as much as 3.6%, 8.7%, and 4.7%, respectively. The **S&P 500** is up 0.8% and the **Nasdaq Composite** is up 1.1%.\n\nAll three cryptocurrencies got a boost from news that the SEC's appeal in its case against **XRP** would be dropped, a major step that confirms the Trump administration's softer approach to crypto regulation, boosting the whole market.\n\n## SEC backs off\n\n[Ripple, the company behind XRP](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/03/06/should-you-buy-xrp-while-its-under-250/), announced that the SEC is abandoning its appeal in the long-running legal battle against the company. The case dates back to 2020 when the SEC sued Ripple for allegedly selling unregistered securities. Ripple scored a partial victory last year when a judge ruled XRP wasn't a security when sold to retail investors -- though institutional sales were different. The SEC appealed this decision, but now, after a change in leadership, the regulator is dropping its appeal.\n\nThis development comes amid a sweeping reversal of the previous administration's crypto crackdown. The SEC recently ended its **Coinbase Global** case, closed investigations into several crypto companies, scaled back enforcement, and declared [meme coins](https://www.fool.com/terms/m/meme-coin/) aren't securities. It's clear that the Trump administration's SEC will not take a hard line in regulating the nascent industry; investors reacted positively.\n\nArrows-InCollapse\n\n![](https://g.foolcdn.com/art/companylogos/mark/BTC.png)\n\n## [CRYPTO: BTC](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/btc/)\n\nBitcoin\n\nToday's Change\n\n(2.95%) $2,464.13\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$85,881.00\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nYTD1w1m3m6m\n1y\n\n\n+22.06%\n\n\n5y\n\nPrice\n\nVS S&P\n\n\nBTC\n\n\n### Key Data Points\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$1.7T\n\nDay's Range\n\n$83,378.00 - $87,431.00\n\n52wk Range\n\n$49,221.15 - $108,785.53\n\nVolume\n\n37,229,486,431\n\nAvg Vol\n\nGross Margin\n\n0.00%\n\nDividend Yield\n\nN/A\n\n## Ethereum's Stablecoin dominance continues\n\nThe crypto market has seen some turbulence in the last few months. However, stablecoins like **USDC** have seen remarkable inflows of capital. The coins, which are fixed in value, are growing in popularity as a sort of digital cash. Most stablecoins exist on a parent blockchain and Ethereum dominates the space. It was reported yesterday that Ethereum's four-month average trading volume for these stablecoins reached $850 billion. The continued dominance shows Ethereum is still holding its lead as the preferred \"smart contract\" blockchain as others have proliferated.\n\nArrows-OutExpand\n\n![](https://g.foolcdn.com/art/companylogos/mark/ETH.png)\n\n## [CRYPTO: ETH](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/eth/)\n\nEthereum\n\nToday's Change\n\n(3.69%) $71.45\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$2,007.41\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nYTD1w1m3m6m\n1y\n\n\n -45.02%\n\n\n5y\n\nPrice\n\nVS S&P\n\n\nETH\n\n\n### Key Data Points\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$242B\n\nDay's Range\n\n$1,935.96 - $2,067.11\n\n52wk Range\n\n$1,791.23 - $4,089.23\n\nVolume\n\n21,439,270,481\n\nAvg Vol\n\nGross Margin\n\n0.00%\n\nDividend Yield\n\nN/A\n\n## Dogecoin's new sponsorship\n\nThe House of Doge and Dogecoin Foundation, organizations that support and promote the cryptocurrency and meme coin, announced a new partnership today.

Derivatives data from Coinglass shows a decline in trade volume, BTC and ETH trade volume declined nearly 11% and 7%.

Meaning Bitcoin derivatives traders expect price to appreciate, even as they reduce their activity in the token, as gathered by Coinglass data.\n\nEthereum supply held by whales, excluding exchanges, sees no significant change, while Bitcoin supply held by funds has reduced consistently. The active addresses in XRP, on the daily timeframe have climbed on Wednesday, after a negative spike on Tuesday, as noted by Santiment.\n\nThe mixed on-chain data suggests a slightly bullish outlook for Bitcoin and XRP and Ethereum price could remain stable or unchanged in the face of upcoming volatility in the prices of the top three cryptocurrencies with the looming FOMC interest rate decision.\n\n![Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP](https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2025/03/Bitcoin-BTC-15.35.01-19-Mar-2025.png)Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP on-chain analysis \\| Source: [Santiment](https://app.santiment.net/charts/cdySJuvR__sCl)\n\nOn the Bitcoin blockchain, the ratio of daily on-chain transactions in profits is nearly double that of transactions in losses, there is scope for profit-taking by traders who bought the token lower. In the case of Ethereum, there is a slight uptick in the supply in profit and the same has been observed in XRP.\n\nEthereum and XRP both offer limited profit-taking opportunities for traders, as seen in the chart below.\n\n![Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP](https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2025/03/Bitcoin-BTC-15.38.03-19-Mar-2025.png)Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP on-chain analysis \\| Source: [Santiment](https://app.santiment.net/charts/cdySJuvR__sCl)\n\nYou might also like:\n[Why did South Korea reject a Bitcoin reserve? How do other countries explain the reluctance to adopt the BTC reserve?](https://crypto.news/why-did-south-korea-reject-a-bitcoin-reserve/)\n\n## Trump push and FOMC rate decision\n\nBitget CEO Gracy Chen told Crypto.news that Trump’s pro-crypto stance has left many traders puzzled. The idea of a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve is gaining traction and while the government is not buying Bitcoin yet, it could soon change.\n\n> “The Stablecoin bill is moving through Congress, signaling a major shift toward a blockchain-based financial system. Some big names, Elon Musk included, are exploring their own stablecoins, and Trump’s team sees stablecoins as a way to protect the dollar’s global reserve status.\n>\n> Then there’s the economy. Scott Bessent’s talk of a “detox period” suggests a controlled downturn might be ahead. If that’s the case, Trump’s playbook seems clear: blame the recession on Biden, use tariffs and crypto narratives to manage costs, and push for lower interest rates to fuel tech and AI growth. Short-term pain, long-term gain — that’s the strategy.”\n\nChen maintains an optimistic outlook on Bitcoin and predicts no fall under $70,000.\n\n> “Bitcoin price drop to possibly 73-78k \\[is likely\\], which is a solid time to enter for any buyers on the fence. In the next 1-2 years, BTC at 200k isn’t as far-fetched as most would think.”\n\nThe FOMC interest rate decision is looming, with the likelihood of higher volatility and price swings as traders react to the news.\n\nRyan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research told Crypto.news in a written note:\n\n> “The FOMC meeting on March 19, 2025, is expected to maintain the federal funds rate at 4.25%-4.50%, with the Fed taking a cautious, data-driven approach amid persistent inflation and solid economic growth.\n>\n> Crypto markets could see a short-term rally if the Fed signals future rate cuts, boosting risk appetite, or a dip if a hawkish stance reinforces tighter financial conditions. However, Bitcoin’s growing resilience and pro-crypto policy tailwinds might temper the broader market impact.”\n\nLee believes that volatility is likely around the announcement, it could be driven by Federal Reserve chair Powell’s remarks and updated rate projections.\n\n> “The crypto market may continue showing increasing independence from Fed decisions. Post-FOMC, Bitcoin is expected to trade within $80,000–$86,000 with 80% confidence, while Ethereum is projected to move between $1,800–$2,100 under the same confidence level. These ranges reflect potential fluctuations tied to macroeconomic signals, investor sentiment, and broader financial conditions.”\n\nYou might also like:\n[Nansen: Whales quietly buy Ethereum as prices stagnate](https://crypto.news/nansen-whales-quietly-buy-ethereum-as-prices-stagnate/)\n\n## Bitcoin eyes return to $87,000, Ethereum could climb to $2,100\n\nBitcoin could return to the $87,000 level as BTC shows signs of recovery on Wednesday. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $83,517, and technical indicators on the daily timeframe show likelihood of gains in the token.\n\nBitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) reads 44 and is sloping upwards, supporting a thesis of positive momentum underlying the token’s price trend.

This marks a gain of nearly 7% in Ethereum price.\n\nTwo key momentum indicators on the Ethereum price chart, RSI and MACD support ETH price recovery on the daily timeframe.\n\nA Bitcoin flashcrash could push Ethereum down to the recent low of $1,754.\n\n![Ethereum USDT price chart](https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2025/03/ETHUSDT_2025-03-19_16-06-34.png)ETH/USDT daily price chart \\| Source: [Crypto.news](https://crypto.news/price/ethereum/)\n\n## XRP price forecast\n\nXRP could rally nearly 7% and test key resistance at the upper boundary of a Fair Value Gap on the daily timeframe at $0.2707.

Should You?\nBy\nAlex Carchidi\n–\n  \n    \n      Mar 18, 2025 at 9:11PM\nKey Points\nAll sorts of investors own Bitcoin and Ethereum nowadays.\nSome of those investors are using them to do less-than-legal things.\nOne unsavory trade in particular is happening in high volume now.\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now ›\nCRYPTO: BTC\nBitcoin\nMarket Cap\n$1.7T\nToday's Change\nArrow-Thin-Down\n(2.92%) $2,434.77\nCurrent Price\n$85,768.00\nPrice as of March 20, 2025, 4:17 a.m. ET\nYou should make your investment decisions on your own, without directly worrying too much about the actions of other investors. But sometimes, certain gargantuan investors, or groups of them, can bring so much capital to bear that their behavior is worth understanding in detail -- especially when they're accumulating relatively volatile assets like\nBitcoin\n(\nBTC\n2.92%\n)\nand\nEthereum\n(\nETH\n3.69%\n)\n.\nThere's one particular and relatively new pattern of behavior among a group of major investors that's important to know about. It might not push the prices of these coins up indefinitely, but it's already having an effect.\nGeopolitics are now undeniably a big part of crypto markets\nBitcoin and Ethereum are assets with a global distribution. That means that in most major economies, people and businesses buy, hold, and sell them, even if it isn't fully legal to do so. In many major countries, cryptocurrency exchanges are operating legally as well. But even fully legal exchanges within well-defined regulatory regimes can be used for illegal or otherwise less-than-wholesome purposes, like dodging international sanctions or\nmoney laundering\n.\nRussia extracts, refines, and sells a lot of oil. In terms of dollars, Russia's oil trade was worth $192 billion in 2024; the country's native currency is the ruble. Much of that trade is oil sales to India, which uses the rupee as its currency, and China, which uses the yuan. But due to international sanctions on Russia stemming from its war against Ukraine, selling oil in exchange for rupees or yuan directly is not as easy as it used to be, as it'd entail violating sanctions.\nSo now, per Reuters reporting in mid-March, Russian oil businesses are using Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies to facilitate their payments and evade the barriers to trade posed by the sanctions.\nTo illustrate how this process works, let's say that a company in India wants to buy oil from Russia. First, the company pays a sketchy middleman, typically a shell company, in rupees. Then, that middleman exchanges the rupees for Bitcoin, Ethereum, or a\nstablecoin\n. This is an action that is not in and of itself in violation of any sanctions, so it isn't inhibited in any way at the point of the exchange. Next, the cryptocurrency is sent to the Russian business selling oil.

However, it's very likely that other exchanges are still in operation, and that more can spring up to take the fallen one's place.\nTherefore, investors should calculate that the sanctions evasion trade is more likely to continue using Bitcoin and Ethereum than it is with stablecoins moving forward.

Learn More A Few Major New Players Are Buying Bitcoin and Ethereum. Should You? By Alex Carchidi – Mar 18, 2025 at 9:11PM Key Points All sorts of investors own Bitcoin and Ethereum nowadays. Some of those investors are using them to do less-than-legal things. One unsavory trade in particular is happening in high volume now. Investor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now › CRYPTO: BTC Bitcoin Market Cap $1.7T Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (2.92%) $2,434.77 Current Price $85,768.00 Price as of March 20, 2025, 4:17 a.m. ET You should make your investment decisions on your own, without directly worrying too much about the actions of other investors. But sometimes, certain gargantuan investors, or groups of them, can bring so much capital to bear that their behavior is worth understanding in detail -- especially when they're accumulating relatively volatile assets like Bitcoin ( BTC 2.92% ) and Ethereum ( ETH 3.69% ) . There's one particular and relatively new pattern of behavior among a group of major investors that's important to know about. It might not push the prices of these coins up indefinitely, but it's already having an effect. Geopolitics are now undeniably a big part of crypto markets Bitcoin and Ethereum are assets with a global distribution. That means that in most major economies, people and businesses buy, hold, and sell them, even if it isn't fully legal to do so. In many major countries, cryptocurrency exchanges are operating legally as well. But even fully legal exchanges within well-defined regulatory regimes can be used for illegal or otherwise less-than-wholesome purposes, like dodging international sanctions or money laundering . Russia extracts, refines, and sells a lot of oil. In terms of dollars, Russia's oil trade was worth $192 billion in 2024; the country's native currency is the ruble. Much of that trade is oil sales to India, which uses the rupee as its currency, and China, which uses the yuan. But due to international sanctions on Russia stemming from its war against Ukraine, selling oil in exchange for rupees or yuan directly is not as easy as it used to be, as it'd entail violating sanctions. So now, per Reuters reporting in mid-March, Russian oil businesses are using Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies to facilitate their payments and evade the barriers to trade posed by the sanctions. To illustrate how this process works, let's say that a company in India wants to buy oil from Russia. First, the company pays a sketchy middleman, typically a shell company, in rupees. Then, that middleman exchanges the rupees for Bitcoin, Ethereum, or a stablecoin . This is an action that is not in and of itself in violation of any sanctions, so it isn't inhibited in any way at the point of the exchange. Next, the cryptocurrency is sent to the Russian business selling oil. That business then sells its crypto to convert it into rubles. The payment is cleared, and the oil is transferred accordingly, effectively skirting the sanctions. One Russian crypto exchange faced sanctions from the U.S. and European Union for facilitating this type of workaround in 2022.

With BexBack’s 100% deposit bonus , traders can amplify their profits even further: If the initial deposit is 2 BTC, the bonus doubles it to 4 BTC. Under the same scenario, the profit would increase to 10 BTC, making the return on investment an impressive 1000%. It is important to note that while leverage increases profit potential, it also comes with the risk of liquidation, so risk management is essential. How Does the 100% Deposit Bonus Work? BexBack’s 100% deposit bonus cannot be directly withdrawn but can be used to open larger trading positions and increase profit potential. During times of significant market fluctuations, the bonus can also serve as additional margin , helping reduce the risk of liquidation.

Analysts from Bitfinex attributed the drop to macroeconomic concerns and the Ethereum network’s high transaction fees discouraging new projects. “A lack of new projects or builders moving to ETH, primarily due to high operating fees, is likely the principal reason behind the lackluster performance of ETH,” the analysts [said](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ether-1-8k-correction-global-tariff-fears-eth-etf-outflows).\n\nThe broader crypto market has also been affected, with Bitcoin and other assets experiencing a sell-off.

While this might signal an incoming crypto rally, do not ignore the market's inherent volatility and risks associated with hype-driven investments. Moreover, regulatory ambiguity around this asset class is another reason you should be careful while investing in this asset.\n\n![Should I invest in Bitcoin?](https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-119044145,width-300,height-225,imgsize-159732,resizemode-75/should-i-invest-in-bitcoin.jpg)Getty ImagesBefore investing in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, make sure to check the authenticity of the application you are using. Also, do not invest in coins that are merely driven by hype, and have no actual, real-world value.\n\nWith bears champing at the bit and dragging down the overall market sentiment, an unlikely spike has managed to lift a section of Indian investors. The recent announcement by US President [Donald Trump](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/panache/panache-people-101/donald-trump/profileshow/79057526.cms) to create a “strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital assets stockpile” has sent the [crypto](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency) enthusiasts in India into a tizzy. Hoping to cash in on what they believe could be the next big rally, they have led a surge in trading volumes, with CoinDCX reporting a 36% hike and Mudrex registering a 30% spike.\n\nWhile the reserve will only include Bitcoin, already owned by the US government, not acquired or actively bought, the digital asset stockpile will consist of tokens other than the Bitcoin—Ethereum (ETH), [Solana](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/solana) (SOL), [Ripple](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ripple) ( [XRP](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/xrp)), and [Cardano](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/cardano) (ADA), which will also not be acquired. The announcement is significant because it’s the first time that Bitcoin has been recognised as a reserve asset of the US government.\n\n“This sends a powerful message to the world about how blockchain and digital assets are becoming mainstream,” says Sumit Gupta, co-founder of CoinDCX. Agrees Edul Patel, Co-founder of Mudrex: “There is a strong future for crypto and Bitcoin globally, not just in the US.”\n\n## Chase hype, pay the price\n\nCryptocurrency is a sentiment-driven market, and its volatile nature is no secret. In fact, Trump’s earlier promise of such a reserve and ease of regulation had seen the token surge to an all-time high of $109,071.8 in January.\n\nWhile his recent announcement has again fuelled the sentiments, over the years, such bold statements have been used by influential names to sway the market. This event may not be any different. If such a reserve and stockpile are built, there could be a sharp rise in the prices of select coins, with the possibility of market manipulation as well. If big players can move prices with a single announcement or policy shift, it raises serious concerns about fair play.\n\n![ET logo](https://img.etimg.com/photo/118783427.cms)\n\n### Live Events\n\nWithout strict supervision, those with insider knowledge could take advantage of these swings to cash in, while retail investors are likely to be caught off guard. For investors, this means additional risk and [volatility](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/volatility) because they could end up buying at inflated prices and suffer losses when the hype dies down and prices settle.\n\nTake the meme coin craze and the metaverse hype in 2021. Tech billionaire and a part of Trump’s team, Elon Musk, openly backed Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, triggering a massive bull run in both coins. Around the same time, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s talk about the metaverse sent coins like Decentraland’s MANA soaring. However, these fizzled out as quickly as they had shot up. Many investors who jumped in due to the fear of missing out incurred massive losses.\n\nAnish Bhilwara was one such investor. The 24-year-old entrepreneur invested all his savings worth Rs. 60,000 in Shiba Inu, Doge, Ripple, BitTorrent and Polymesh in 2021, giving in to the hype of meme coins. “I just wanted to prove myself to my family,” says Bhilwara, who ended up losing 85% of his investment. Hoping to recover his losses over time, Bhilwara stayed invested but lost again when [WazirX](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/wazirx) was hacked.\n\nThese are regular occurrences in the world of cryptocurrency, especially those who invest in hype-driven alt coins. Sunil Mahajan (name changed) faced a similar fate.

While this might signal an incoming crypto rally, do not ignore the market's inherent volatility and risks associated with hype-driven investments. Moreover, regulatory ambiguity around this asset class is another reason you should be careful while investing in this asset.\n\n![Should I invest in Bitcoin?](https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-119044145,width-300,height-225,imgsize-159732,resizemode-75/should-i-invest-in-bitcoin.jpg)Getty ImagesBefore investing in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, make sure to check the authenticity of the application you are using. Also, do not invest in coins that are merely driven by hype, and have no actual, real-world value.\n\nWith bears champing at the bit and dragging down the overall market sentiment, an unlikely spike has managed to lift a section of Indian investors. The recent announcement by US President [Donald Trump](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/panache/panache-people-101/donald-trump/profileshow/79057526.cms) to create a “strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital assets stockpile” has sent the [crypto](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency) enthusiasts in India into a tizzy. Hoping to cash in on what they believe could be the next big rally, they have led a surge in trading volumes, with CoinDCX reporting a 36% hike and Mudrex registering a 30% spike.\n\nWhile the reserve will only include Bitcoin, already owned by the US government, not acquired or actively bought, the digital asset stockpile will consist of tokens other than the Bitcoin—Ethereum (ETH), [Solana](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/solana) (SOL), [Ripple](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ripple) ( [XRP](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/xrp)), and [Cardano](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/cardano) (ADA), which will also not be acquired. The announcement is significant because it’s the first time that Bitcoin has been recognised as a reserve asset of the US government.\n\n“This sends a powerful message to the world about how blockchain and digital assets are becoming mainstream,” says Sumit Gupta, co-founder of CoinDCX. Agrees Edul Patel, Co-founder of Mudrex: “There is a strong future for crypto and Bitcoin globally, not just in the US.”\n\n## Chase hype, pay the price\n\nCryptocurrency is a sentiment-driven market, and its volatile nature is no secret. In fact, Trump’s earlier promise of such a reserve and ease of regulation had seen the token surge to an all-time high of $109,071.8 in January.\n\nWhile his recent announcement has again fuelled the sentiments, over the years, such bold statements have been used by influential names to sway the market. This event may not be any different. If such a reserve and stockpile are built, there could be a sharp rise in the prices of select coins, with the possibility of market manipulation as well. If big players can move prices with a single announcement or policy shift, it raises serious concerns about fair play.\n\n![ET logo](https://img.etimg.com/photo/118783427.cms)\n\n### Live Events\n\nWithout strict supervision, those with insider knowledge could take advantage of these swings to cash in, while retail investors are likely to be caught off guard. For investors, this means additional risk and [volatility](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/volatility) because they could end up buying at inflated prices and suffer losses when the hype dies down and prices settle.\n\nTake the meme coin craze and the metaverse hype in 2021. Tech billionaire and a part of Trump’s team, Elon Musk, openly backed Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, triggering a massive bull run in both coins. Around the same time, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s talk about the metaverse sent coins like Decentraland’s MANA soaring. However, these fizzled out as quickly as they had shot up. Many investors who jumped in due to the fear of missing out incurred massive losses.\n\nAnish Bhilwara was one such investor. The 24-year-old entrepreneur invested all his savings worth Rs. 60,000 in Shiba Inu, Doge, Ripple, BitTorrent and Polymesh in 2021, giving in to the hype of meme coins. “I just wanted to prove myself to my family,” says Bhilwara, who ended up losing 85% of his investment. Hoping to recover his losses over time, Bhilwara stayed invested but lost again when [WazirX](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/wazirx) was hacked.\n\nThese are regular occurrences in the world of cryptocurrency, especially those who invest in hype-driven alt coins. Sunil Mahajan (name changed) faced a similar fate. The 45-year-old IT professional saw initial success by investing in Bitcoin, [Ethereum](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ethereum), and XRP. “These were long-term bets, and they worked well for me,” he says.\n\nWhen his friends started pouring money into meme coins, FOMO kicked in. Mahajan invested Rs.20 lakh across various coins. Today, they’re worth Rs.10 lakh. “I invested through WazirX, but now they are going to pay only 60% of the remaining amount (ET Wealth could not independently verify this claim) because it got hacked. I am never investing in crypto again,” says Mahajan, who invested to buy a Mercedes. “Now I can’t even buy a decent car,” he says wryly. Mahajan believes his mistake wasn’t in choosing Bitcoin or ETH, but in letting emotions drive his bets.\n\nThis is the reason the Indian government has consistently discouraged crypto investments. The RBI had banned trading in crypto in 2018, but the Supreme Court lifted it in 2020. Despite this, the government has tried to ward off enthusiastic investors by taxing crypto gains at 30% and not allowing losses from crypto trading to be set off against profits from other trading.\n\nThe 2025 budget has tightened the screws further. “Virtual digital assets, including cryptocurrencies and NFTs, are now categorised under undisclosed income, subjecting these to higher tax rates,” says Akshat Pande, Managing Partner, Alpha Partners.\n\n**Bitcoin volatility over the years**\n\nThe high volatility posed a risk for investors.\n\n![im1-](https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-42031747/et-logo.jpg)\n\n## What should you do?\n\nIn line with most experts’ opinion, ET Wealth doesn’t recommend investing in cryptos since it remains a high-risk option, and the US creating a reserve could add more uncertainty. “Crypto may not be a good investment idea unless there’s clarity on its overall regulatory acceptance,” cautions Rohit Shah, Founder and CEO, GYR Financial Planners. Until the regulatory landscape is clearer, investors would be better off restraining from cryptos.\n\nIf, however, you wish to experiment or are curious, stick to blue-chip coins.

Other coins are sentiment-driven and more like a gamble. The top five blue-chip coins include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Solana, and Ripple. However, be careful of the amount you invest.

While this might signal an incoming crypto rally, do not ignore the market's inherent volatility and risks associated with hype-driven investments. Moreover, regulatory ambiguity around this asset class is another reason you should be careful while investing in this asset.\n\n![Should I invest in Bitcoin?](https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-119044145,width-300,height-225,imgsize-159732,resizemode-75/should-i-invest-in-bitcoin.jpg)Getty ImagesBefore investing in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, make sure to check the authenticity of the application you are using. Also, do not invest in coins that are merely driven by hype, and have no actual, real-world value.\n\nWith bears champing at the bit and dragging down the overall market sentiment, an unlikely spike has managed to lift a section of Indian investors. The recent announcement by US President [Donald Trump](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/panache/panache-people-101/donald-trump/profileshow/79057526.cms) to create a “strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital assets stockpile” has sent the [crypto](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency) enthusiasts in India into a tizzy. Hoping to cash in on what they believe could be the next big rally, they have led a surge in trading volumes, with CoinDCX reporting a 36% hike and Mudrex registering a 30% spike.\n\nWhile the reserve will only include Bitcoin, already owned by the US government, not acquired or actively bought, the digital asset stockpile will consist of tokens other than the Bitcoin—Ethereum (ETH), [Solana](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/solana) (SOL), [Ripple](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ripple) ( [XRP](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/xrp)), and [Cardano](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/cardano) (ADA), which will also not be acquired. The announcement is significant because it’s the first time that Bitcoin has been recognised as a reserve asset of the US government.\n\n“This sends a powerful message to the world about how blockchain and digital assets are becoming mainstream,” says Sumit Gupta, co-founder of CoinDCX. Agrees Edul Patel, Co-founder of Mudrex: “There is a strong future for crypto and Bitcoin globally, not just in the US.”\n\n## Chase hype, pay the price\n\nCryptocurrency is a sentiment-driven market, and its volatile nature is no secret. In fact, Trump’s earlier promise of such a reserve and ease of regulation had seen the token surge to an all-time high of $109,071.8 in January.\n\nWhile his recent announcement has again fuelled the sentiments, over the years, such bold statements have been used by influential names to sway the market. This event may not be any different. If such a reserve and stockpile are built, there could be a sharp rise in the prices of select coins, with the possibility of market manipulation as well. If big players can move prices with a single announcement or policy shift, it raises serious concerns about fair play.\n\n![ET logo](https://img.etimg.com/photo/118783427.cms)\n\n### Live Events\n\nWithout strict supervision, those with insider knowledge could take advantage of these swings to cash in, while retail investors are likely to be caught off guard. For investors, this means additional risk and [volatility](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/volatility) because they could end up buying at inflated prices and suffer losses when the hype dies down and prices settle.\n\nTake the meme coin craze and the metaverse hype in 2021. Tech billionaire and a part of Trump’s team, Elon Musk, openly backed Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, triggering a massive bull run in both coins. Around the same time, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s talk about the metaverse sent coins like Decentraland’s MANA soaring. However, these fizzled out as quickly as they had shot up. Many investors who jumped in due to the fear of missing out incurred massive losses.\n\nAnish Bhilwara was one such investor. The 24-year-old entrepreneur invested all his savings worth Rs. 60,000 in Shiba Inu, Doge, Ripple, BitTorrent and Polymesh in 2021, giving in to the hype of meme coins. “I just wanted to prove myself to my family,” says Bhilwara, who ended up losing 85% of his investment. Hoping to recover his losses over time, Bhilwara stayed invested but lost again when [WazirX](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/wazirx) was hacked.\n\nThese are regular occurrences in the world of cryptocurrency, especially those who invest in hype-driven alt coins. Sunil Mahajan (name changed) faced a similar fate. The 45-year-old IT professional saw initial success by investing in Bitcoin, [Ethereum](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ethereum), and XRP. “These were long-term bets, and they worked well for me,” he says.\n\nWhen his friends started pouring money into meme coins, FOMO kicked in. Mahajan invested Rs.20 lakh across various coins. Today, they’re worth Rs.10 lakh. “I invested through WazirX, but now they are going to pay only 60% of the remaining amount (ET Wealth could not independently verify this claim) because it got hacked. I am never investing in crypto again,” says Mahajan, who invested to buy a Mercedes. “Now I can’t even buy a decent car,” he says wryly. Mahajan believes his mistake wasn’t in choosing Bitcoin or ETH, but in letting emotions drive his bets.\n\nThis is the reason the Indian government has consistently discouraged crypto investments. The RBI had banned trading in crypto in 2018, but the Supreme Court lifted it in 2020. Despite this, the government has tried to ward off enthusiastic investors by taxing crypto gains at 30% and not allowing losses from crypto trading to be set off against profits from other trading.\n\nThe 2025 budget has tightened the screws further. “Virtual digital assets, including cryptocurrencies and NFTs, are now categorised under undisclosed income, subjecting these to higher tax rates,” says Akshat Pande, Managing Partner, Alpha Partners.\n\n**Bitcoin volatility over the years**\n\nThe high volatility posed a risk for investors.\n\n![im1-](https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-42031747/et-logo.jpg)\n\n## What should you do?\n\nIn line with most experts’ opinion, ET Wealth doesn’t recommend investing in cryptos since it remains a high-risk option, and the US creating a reserve could add more uncertainty. “Crypto may not be a good investment idea unless there’s clarity on its overall regulatory acceptance,” cautions Rohit Shah, Founder and CEO, GYR Financial Planners. Until the regulatory landscape is clearer, investors would be better off restraining from cryptos.\n\nIf, however, you wish to experiment or are curious, stick to blue-chip coins. Though these, too, are volatile, they are cyclical in nature. If you end up losing money, you may earn it back if you stay invested for a long time. Other coins are sentiment-driven and more like a gamble. The top five blue-chip coins include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Solana, and Ripple. However, be careful of the amount you invest. No more than 2-5% of your portfolio should be allocated to crypto currency. Or only as much as you can afford to see go up in smoke.\n\n## Before you invest in crypto...\n\n_To minimise your losses, consider these tips while investing._\n\n_**Invest via fiu-ind platform**_\n\n_The registration with Financial Intelligence Unit, India, shows the exchange’s commitment to following the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) guidelines. Opt for compliant platforms to protect your assets._\n\n_**Beware of fake apps, websites**_\n\n_To avoid scams, verify the authenticity of a website or app and check if it is regulated by a reputable authority._\n\n_**Research & understand**_\n\n_Research the underlying technology, use case, and adoption potential of the coin. Do not fall for hype-driven coins that lack real-world utility._\n\n_**Have an investing cap**_\n\n_Avoid taking loans or using emergency funds; invest only the amount you can afford to lose.

Binance’s billionaire founder, Changpeng Zhao, who served four months in prison after pleading guilty to violating anti-money-laundering requirements, has been pushing for the Trump administration to grant him a pardon, sources added.\n\nFollowing the report, Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance and its ex-CEO, [stated in a post to X:](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4089128&headline=$BTC;MSTR;COIN;MARA;RIOT;BTBT;BITF;WULF;GREE;SDIG;CORZ;$ECON;SPY;SPX-Changpeng-Zhao-says-WSJ-article-got-the-facts-wrong-about-Binance&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=COIN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) “Sorry to disappoint. The WSJ article got the facts wrong. More than 20 people have told me they were asked by the WSJ (and another media), ‘Can you confirm that CZ made some deal for a pardon?’ They probably asked hundreds of people to have 20 people reach out to me. In essence, they tried hard to make a story to report. Fact: I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with … well, anyone. No felon would mind a pardon, especially being the only one in US history who was ever sentenced to prison for a single BSA charge. Feels like the article is motivated as an attack on the President and crypto, and the residual forces of the ‘war on crypto’ from the last administration are still at work. I am always happy to make crypto great everywhere, US and the rest of the world. It’s good to see that even WSJ thinks I should be pardoned.”\n\n**COINBASE SECURES REGISTRATION IN INDIA:** Coinbase [(COIN)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=COIN&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) announced Tuesday it [has registered with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4087848&headline=COIN-Coinbase-secures-registration-in-India&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=COIN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), which marks a significant milestone in its international expansion strategy. The company plans to launch its initial retail services later this year, followed by additional investment and products in India thereafter. “We’re committed to building in markets that believe in the potential of crypto and onchain innovation,” said John O’Loghlen, Regional Managing Director for APAC at Coinbase. “India represents one of the most exciting market opportunities in the world today, and we’re proud to deepen our investment here in full compliance with local regulations.”\n\nStory Continues\n\nAdditionally on Tuesday, Mizuho lowered the firm’s price target on Coinbase [to $217 from $280 and kept a Neutral rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4087037&headline=COIN-Mizuho-cuts-Coinbase-target-calls--pullback-overdone&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=COIN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares. The firm said that since its last model update on February 20, the price of [bitcoin](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) has fallen from $98,000 to $79,000 and Coinbase shares are down 30%. While some multiple compression is warranted due to lower multiples across technology, the move in Coinbase shares is overdone, the analyst said. Mizuho believes the stock should trade closer to $217. While it sees some upside from here, it remains Neutral given the longer-term risk of pricing pressure from increased competition across the crypto trading space. Mizuho cited lower market multiples for the target cut.\n\n**BIT DIGITAL REPORTS FY24 RESULTS:** On Friday, Bit Digital [(BTBT)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=BTBT&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) reported FY24 [earnings per share of 19c on revenue of $108.1M,](https://bit-digital.com/press-releases/bit-digital-inc-announces-fiscal-year-2024-financial-results/?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) which compared to a loss per share of (16c) on revenue of $44.9M last year. The company earned 949.9 bitcoins during 2024, a 37% decrease from the prior year, and treasury holdings of BTC and ETH were 741.9 and 27,623.2, respectively, with a fair market value of approximately $69.3M and $92.1M on December 31, respectively.\n\nThe company said, “2024 marked a pivotal shift for Bit Digital. Our business was historically driven by digital asset mining, but the successful launch and rapid expansion of our HPC business fundamentally reshaped our company. This evolution drove over 140% revenue growth, with these new business lines contributing nearly half of total revenue. A defining milestone in this transformation was our acquisition of Enovum Data Centers in October. More than just an infrastructure expansion, Enovum provided us with a proven team, operational expertise, and a scalable platform to develop and operate data centers. It also introduced colocation services as a new business line, further diversifying our revenue streams and strengthening our [AI](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) compute capabilities. Bitcoin mining remained a key revenue contributor, generating $58.6M, a 32% increase year-over-year. However, as our HPC business scaled, mining’s share of total revenue declined to 54% in 2024, and further to 40% in Q424, compared to 98% in 2023. This shift underscores our strategic pivot toward infrastructure-driven revenue streams while maintaining disciplined mining operations.”\n\n**ANALYSTS UPDATES BITCOIN MINER MODELS:** On Thursday, JPMorgan downgraded Cipher Mining [(](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=CIFR&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) CIFR) to [Neutral from Overweight without a price target.](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088576&headline=CIFR-Cipher-Mining-just-downgraded-at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=CIFR&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) The firm updated bitcoin miner price targets and models to reflect the Q4 results and changes in bitcoin price and the network hash rate. The firm now sees less upside potential relative to peers for Cipher Mining shares. Cipher could sign a high performance compute deal at its Barber Lake site, which could drive upside, but deals can take up to nine months to negotiate and finalize, the analyst said.\n\nJPMorgan also lowered the firm’s price target on Mara Holdings [(MARA)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=MARA&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [$18 from $23 and kept a Neutral rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088580&headline=MARA-Mara-Holdings-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=MARA&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares as well as on CleanSpark [(](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=CLSK&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) CLSK) to [$12 from $17 and kept an Overweight rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088579&headline=CLSK-CleanSpark-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=CLSK&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares and on Riot Platforms [(RIOT)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=RIOT&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [$13 from $16 and kept an Overweight rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088581&headline=RIOT-Riot-Platforms-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=RIOT&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares.\n\nAdditionally, the firm upgraded IREN [(IREN)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=IREN&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $12, down from $15](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088578&headline=IREN-IREN-just-upgraded-at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=IREN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral). JPMorgan named IREN its top pick citing the company’s “strong” mining operations and high performance computing “optionality.” The shares have “been overly punished” year-to-date, and offer 70% upside at current levels, which could prove conservative if IREN announces an HPC deal with a name-brand tenant, the analyst said.\n\n**HIVE PRICE TARGET LOWERED:** Cantor Fitzgerald lowered the firm’s price target on [Hive](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hive?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) Digital [(HIVE)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=HIVE&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on Tuesday [to $8 from $11 and kept an Overweight rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4087369&headline=HIVE-Hive-Digital-price-target-lowered-by--at-Cantor-Fitzgerald-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=HIVE&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares. Hive said it mined 89 bitcoin during the month of February, or 3.1 bitcoin per day, a decrease from 102 bitcoin mined in January, and its share of the overall bitcoin network decreased to 0.69% from 0.73% on a peak hash rate basis, the analyst said. Cantor continues to believe that current levels represent an attractive risk/reward, as the firm is confident in Hive’s ability to execute on its bitcoin mining and AI Cloud targets, which will represent 300% hash rate growth and $100M in annualized run-rate revenue in 2025, respectively.\n\n**CRYPTO STOCK PLAYS:** Publicly traded companies in the space include Bit Digital, Coinbase, Core Scientific [(CORZ)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=CORZ&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), Greenidge Generation [(GREE)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=GREE&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), Mara Holdings, Strategy [(MSTR)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=MSTR&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), Riot Platforms, Stronghold Digital Mining [(SDIG)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=SDIG&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) and TeraWulf [(WULF)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=WULF&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral).\n\n**PRICE ACTION:** As of time of writing, bitcoin dropped about 6% this week to $83,160 in U.S. dollars, according to CoinDesk.\n\n_Published first on [TheFly](https://thefly.com/?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

Binance’s billionaire founder, Changpeng Zhao, who served four months in prison after pleading guilty to violating anti-money-laundering requirements, has been pushing for the Trump administration to grant him a pardon, sources added.\n\nFollowing the report, Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance and its ex-CEO, [stated in a post to X:](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4089128&headline=$BTC;MSTR;COIN;MARA;RIOT;BTBT;BITF;WULF;GREE;SDIG;CORZ;$ECON;SPY;SPX-Changpeng-Zhao-says-WSJ-article-got-the-facts-wrong-about-Binance&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=COIN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) “Sorry to disappoint. The WSJ article got the facts wrong. More than 20 people have told me they were asked by the WSJ (and another media), ‘Can you confirm that CZ made some deal for a pardon?’ They probably asked hundreds of people to have 20 people reach out to me. In essence, they tried hard to make a story to report. Fact: I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with … well, anyone. No felon would mind a pardon, especially being the only one in US history who was ever sentenced to prison for a single BSA charge. Feels like the article is motivated as an attack on the President and crypto, and the residual forces of the ‘war on crypto’ from the last administration are still at work. I am always happy to make crypto great everywhere, US and the rest of the world. It’s good to see that even WSJ thinks I should be pardoned.”\n\n**COINBASE SECURES REGISTRATION IN INDIA:** Coinbase [(COIN)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=COIN&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) announced Tuesday it [has registered with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4087848&headline=COIN-Coinbase-secures-registration-in-India&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=COIN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), which marks a significant milestone in its international expansion strategy. The company plans to launch its initial retail services later this year, followed by additional investment and products in India thereafter. “We’re committed to building in markets that believe in the potential of crypto and onchain innovation,” said John O’Loghlen, Regional Managing Director for APAC at Coinbase. “India represents one of the most exciting market opportunities in the world today, and we’re proud to deepen our investment here in full compliance with local regulations.”\n\nStory Continues\n\nAdditionally on Tuesday, Mizuho lowered the firm’s price target on Coinbase [to $217 from $280 and kept a Neutral rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4087037&headline=COIN-Mizuho-cuts-Coinbase-target-calls--pullback-overdone&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=COIN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares. The firm said that since its last model update on February 20, the price of [bitcoin](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) has fallen from $98,000 to $79,000 and Coinbase shares are down 30%. While some multiple compression is warranted due to lower multiples across technology, the move in Coinbase shares is overdone, the analyst said. Mizuho believes the stock should trade closer to $217. While it sees some upside from here, it remains Neutral given the longer-term risk of pricing pressure from increased competition across the crypto trading space. Mizuho cited lower market multiples for the target cut.\n\n**BIT DIGITAL REPORTS FY24 RESULTS:** On Friday, Bit Digital [(BTBT)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=BTBT&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) reported FY24 [earnings per share of 19c on revenue of $108.1M,](https://bit-digital.com/press-releases/bit-digital-inc-announces-fiscal-year-2024-financial-results/?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) which compared to a loss per share of (16c) on revenue of $44.9M last year. The company earned 949.9 bitcoins during 2024, a 37% decrease from the prior year, and treasury holdings of BTC and ETH were 741.9 and 27,623.2, respectively, with a fair market value of approximately $69.3M and $92.1M on December 31, respectively.\n\nThe company said, “2024 marked a pivotal shift for Bit Digital. Our business was historically driven by digital asset mining, but the successful launch and rapid expansion of our HPC business fundamentally reshaped our company. This evolution drove over 140% revenue growth, with these new business lines contributing nearly half of total revenue. A defining milestone in this transformation was our acquisition of Enovum Data Centers in October. More than just an infrastructure expansion, Enovum provided us with a proven team, operational expertise, and a scalable platform to develop and operate data centers. It also introduced colocation services as a new business line, further diversifying our revenue streams and strengthening our [AI](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) compute capabilities. Bitcoin mining remained a key revenue contributor, generating $58.6M, a 32% increase year-over-year. However, as our HPC business scaled, mining’s share of total revenue declined to 54% in 2024, and further to 40% in Q424, compared to 98% in 2023. This shift underscores our strategic pivot toward infrastructure-driven revenue streams while maintaining disciplined mining operations.”\n\n**ANALYSTS UPDATES BITCOIN MINER MODELS:** On Thursday, JPMorgan downgraded Cipher Mining [(](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=CIFR&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) CIFR) to [Neutral from Overweight without a price target.](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088576&headline=CIFR-Cipher-Mining-just-downgraded-at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=CIFR&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) The firm updated bitcoin miner price targets and models to reflect the Q4 results and changes in bitcoin price and the network hash rate. The firm now sees less upside potential relative to peers for Cipher Mining shares. Cipher could sign a high performance compute deal at its Barber Lake site, which could drive upside, but deals can take up to nine months to negotiate and finalize, the analyst said.\n\nJPMorgan also lowered the firm’s price target on Mara Holdings [(MARA)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=MARA&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [$18 from $23 and kept a Neutral rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088580&headline=MARA-Mara-Holdings-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=MARA&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares as well as on CleanSpark [(](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=CLSK&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) CLSK) to [$12 from $17 and kept an Overweight rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088579&headline=CLSK-CleanSpark-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=CLSK&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares and on Riot Platforms [(RIOT)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=RIOT&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [$13 from $16 and kept an Overweight rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088581&headline=RIOT-Riot-Platforms-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=RIOT&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares.\n\nAdditionally, the firm upgraded IREN [(IREN)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=IREN&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $12, down from $15](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088578&headline=IREN-IREN-just-upgraded-at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=IREN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral). JPMorgan named IREN its top pick citing the company’s “strong” mining operations and high performance computing “optionality.” The shares have “been overly punished” year-to-date, and offer 70% upside at current levels, which could prove conservative if IREN announces an HPC deal with a name-brand tenant, the analyst said.\n\n**HIVE PRICE TARGET LOWERED:** Cantor Fitzgerald lowered the firm’s price target on [Hive](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hive?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) Digital [(HIVE)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=HIVE&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on Tuesday [to $8 from $11 and kept an Overweight rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4087369&headline=HIVE-Hive-Digital-price-target-lowered-by--at-Cantor-Fitzgerald-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=HIVE&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares. Hive said it mined 89 bitcoin during the month of February, or 3.1 bitcoin per day, a decrease from 102 bitcoin mined in January, and its share of the overall bitcoin network decreased to 0.69% from 0.73% on a peak hash rate basis, the analyst said. Cantor continues to believe that current levels represent an attractive risk/reward, as the firm is confident in Hive’s ability to execute on its bitcoin mining and AI Cloud targets, which will represent 300% hash rate growth and $100M in annualized run-rate revenue in 2025, respectively.\n\n**CRYPTO STOCK PLAYS:** Publicly traded companies in the space include Bit Digital, Coinbase, Core Scientific [(CORZ)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=CORZ&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), Greenidge Generation [(GREE)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=GREE&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), Mara Holdings, Strategy [(MSTR)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=MSTR&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), Riot Platforms, Stronghold Digital Mining [(SDIG)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=SDIG&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) and TeraWulf [(WULF)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=WULF&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral).\n\n**PRICE ACTION:** As of time of writing, bitcoin dropped about 6% this week to $83,160 in U.S. dollars, according to CoinDesk.\n\n_Published first on [TheFly](https://thefly.com/?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

Cipher could sign a high performance compute deal at its Barber Lake site, which could drive upside, but deals can take up to nine months to negotiate and finalize, the analyst said.\n\nJPMorgan also lowered the firm’s price target on Mara Holdings [(MARA)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=MARA&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [$18 from $23 and kept a Neutral rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088580&headline=MARA-Mara-Holdings-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=MARA&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares as well as on CleanSpark [(](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=CLSK&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) CLSK) to [$12 from $17 and kept an Overweight rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088579&headline=CLSK-CleanSpark-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=CLSK&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares and on Riot Platforms [(RIOT)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=RIOT&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [$13 from $16 and kept an Overweight rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088581&headline=RIOT-Riot-Platforms-price-target-lowered-by--at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=RIOT&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares.\n\nAdditionally, the firm upgraded IREN [(IREN)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=IREN&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to [Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $12, down from $15](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4088578&headline=IREN-IREN-just-upgraded-at-JPMorgan-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=IREN&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral). JPMorgan named IREN its top pick citing the company’s “strong” mining operations and high performance computing “optionality.” The shares have “been overly punished” year-to-date, and offer 70% upside at current levels, which could prove conservative if IREN announces an HPC deal with a name-brand tenant, the analyst said.\n\n**HIVE PRICE TARGET LOWERED:** Cantor Fitzgerald lowered the firm’s price target on [Hive](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hive?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) Digital [(HIVE)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=HIVE&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on Tuesday [to $8 from $11 and kept an Overweight rating](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=4087369&headline=HIVE-Hive-Digital-price-target-lowered-by--at-Cantor-Fitzgerald-heres-why&utm_source=https://thefly.com/news.php%3fsymbol=HIVE&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=referral_traffic&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) on the shares. Hive said it mined 89 bitcoin during the month of February, or 3.1 bitcoin per day, a decrease from 102 bitcoin mined in January, and its share of the overall bitcoin network decreased to 0.69% from 0.73% on a peak hash rate basis, the analyst said. Cantor continues to believe that current levels represent an attractive risk/reward, as the firm is confident in Hive’s ability to execute on its bitcoin mining and AI Cloud targets, which will represent 300% hash rate growth and $100M in annualized run-rate revenue in 2025, respectively.\n\n**CRYPTO STOCK PLAYS:** Publicly traded companies in the space include Bit Digital, Coinbase, Core Scientific [(CORZ)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=CORZ&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), Greenidge Generation [(GREE)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=GREE&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), Mara Holdings, Strategy [(MSTR)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=MSTR&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), Riot Platforms, Stronghold Digital Mining [(SDIG)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=SDIG&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) and TeraWulf [(WULF)](https://www.thefly.com/news.php?symbol=WULF&utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral).\n\n**PRICE ACTION:** As of time of writing, bitcoin dropped about 6% this week to $83,160 in U.S. dollars, according to CoinDesk.\n\n_Published first on [TheFly](https://thefly.com/?utm_source=finance.yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.
