Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.\n\n1076 Views\n\nRussia has started using crypto for oil trades with China and India as it seeks to bypass Western sanctions, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-leans-cryptocurrencies-oil-trade-sources-say-2025-03-14/) on March 14, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n\nAccording to the report, some Russian oil companies have settled trades in [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/), [Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/), and stablecoins like Tether’s [USDT](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/). This strategy simplifies the conversion of Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupees into Russian Rubles, enabling smoother transactions despite financial restrictions.\n\nTypically, a Chinese buyer deposits Yuan into an offshore account controlled by an intermediary. The funds are then converted into crypto and transferred through multiple accounts before reaching a final destination in Russia, where they are exchanged for Rubles.\n\nThese transactions reportedly reach tens of millions of dollars per month.\n\nAlthough crypto adoption in Russia’s oil trade remains limited, it is [part of a broader trend](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-firms-turn-to-bitcoin-stablecoins-for-global-trade-amid-sanctions/). Over the past year, the country has [introduced new regulations](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-contemplating-permanently-legalizing-stablecoins-for-cross-border-payments/) governing [crypto mining](https://cryptoslate.com/russias-bitcoin-mining-demand-triples-amid-regulatory-shifts-and-price-rally/), taxation, and international trade.\n\n[Western sanctions imposed over Russia’s](https://cryptoslate.com/tether-freezes-27m-on-garantex-forcing-halt-of-russian-linked-exchange/) military actions in Ukraine have accelerated this shift toward digital assets. However, industry sources suggest oil firms may continue using cryptocurrencies even if sanctions are lifted due to their efficiency and transaction speed.\n\n## Digital rubles challenges\n\nWhile Russia increases its reliance on crypto for trade, its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project is facing significant hurdles.\n\nLast month, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina [announced](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-delays-digital-ruble-cbdc-launch-extends-pilot-phase-indefinitely/) an indefinite delay in the launch of the digital ruble. She attributed the setback to the need for further refinements to ensure that the currency benefits all stakeholders.\n\nHowever, a recent survey indicates that the digital ruble launch was postponed due to the inadequate IT infrastructure of banks that were expected to handle the project.\n\nThe survey of Russian banking experts revealed that 30% of financial institutions are not yet prepared to support the digital ruble. Experts explained that implementing the CBDC requires banks to upgrade their IT systems to handle increased transaction volumes.\n\nMeanwhile, 20% of banking IT specialists stated that their systems are fully equipped for the digital ruble. Another 50% said they are partially prepared but need further upgrades.\n\nAt the same time, around 14% of the respondents expressed concerns over potential information security risks associated with the currency.\n\nGiven these challenges, Russia’s national digital asset initiative could face further obstacles unless major financial institutions fully prepare for its adoption.\n\n###### Mentioned in this article\n\n[![Bitcoin](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/) [![Ethereum](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/) [![Tether](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Tether](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/) [![Tether Limited](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Tether Limited](https://cryptoslate.com/companies/tether/)\n\n[![XRP Turbo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201280%20453%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://link.cryptoslate.com/xrpturbo)\n\nPosted In: [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/news/bitcoin/), [China](https://cryptoslate.com/places/china/), [India](https://cryptoslate.com/places/india/), [Russia](https://cryptoslate.com/places/russia/), [Adoption](https://cryptoslate.com/adoption/), [Crypto](https://cryptoslate.com/crypto/), [Featured](https://cryptoslate.com/featured-news/)\n\nPeople were interested in these podcasts\n\n[Discover more podcasts →](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-oil-firms-using-bitcoin-and-ethereum-for-cross-border-payments-with-china/#)\n\nPlay Episode\n\n36min\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nDecentralizing AI infrastructure with Gaurav Sharma, CTO of io.net\n\nIn a recent SlateCast episode, Gaurav Sharma, CTO of io.net, joined CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill to discuss io.net’s groundbreaking approach to decentralized infrastructure for AI. With a background at tech giants like Binance and Amazon, Sharma brings deep expertise in scaling technology to a decentralized platform. io.net is paving the way for a decentralized ecosystem that aims to democratize access to AI resources, reduce costs, and enable greater innovation.The Vision Behind io.netSharma explained io.net’s role as a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) that leverages community-powered hardware.“Our inventory comes from the community,” Sharma noted. “We don’t own our hardware; we aggregate it from individuals, data centers, and companies.”This model drastically reduces user costs compared to centralized giants like Amazon Web Services (AWS).He highlighted the efficiency of this model:“For instance, an H100 GPU on a centralized platform might cost eight times more than what we offer. Our decentralized model empowers startups by cutting costs and enabling them to allocate resources toward innovation.”Challenges in Decentralized AI InfrastructureBuilding a decentralized AI system presents unique challenges. Sharma emphasized the need for robust distributed systems, scalability, and transparency.“Decentralized infrastructure cannot rely on monolithic tech stacks,” he explained. “The team must excel at distributed systems and computational fundamentals.”Moreover, latency sensitivity and scalability were critical from day one, as io.net’s users often come from high-demand enterprises. Sharma also stressed the importance of trust and transparency in the crypto ecosystem.“Our block explorer showcases every aspect of our network, from GPU availability to revenue metrics. Transparency is the foundation of trust,” he said.Empowering Developers Through TokenomicsOne of io.net’s core innovations is incentivizing co\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nBuilding the decentralized data layer with Powerloom’s Swaroop Hegde\n\nSwaroop Hegde, CEO and Co-Founder of Powerloom, joined CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief, Liam “Akiba” Wright, and CEO Nate Whitehill on The SlateCast to discuss the future of decentralized data layers. Backed by notable names like Blockchain Capital and Filecoin, Powerloom is setting a new standard for composable and decentralized data solutions, reshaping how users interact with on-chain data and fostering innovation across web3 applications.The Challenge of Reliable On-Chain DataSwaroop began by highlighting the current inefficiencies in accessing and verifying on-chain data. Traditional methods rely heavily on centralized sources, such as CoinMarketCap or specific blockchain dashboards, leading to potential data manipulation and outdated information.“Most of the usage when it goes outside of the dApp is actually coming from some sort of centralized indexer,”Swaroop noted, emphasizing the vulnerabilities inherent in such a setup.Powerloom addresses these issues with a decentralized node network, enabling real-time data computation without the need for a centralized intermediary.“With over 5,300 nodes, even non-technical users can contribute to the network, ensuring verifiability and reliability,” he explained.Powerloom’s Unique Approach to Data CompositionUnlike traditional indexers, Powerloom operates on a demand-driven system that aggregates data atomically. Swaroop explained,“We don’t sit and index all the data. Instead, we focus on composing data dynamically based on demand.”This approach allows Powerloom to cater to a variety of use cases, from trading data to lending rates across multiple chains.The platform’s composability extends beyond Uniswap and Aave, creating “data markets” that empower users to craft personalized queries and insights. These markets are decentralized and verifiable, ensuring users can trust the integrity of their data.Introducing Generative Prediction Markets (GPM)A standout feature discussed was Powerloom’s Generative Prediction Markets\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nHow Layer3 is reshaping on-chain user value - Brandon Kumar explains\n\nCryptoSlate’s SlateCast recently welcomed Brandon Kumar, co-founder of Layer3, to discuss the platform’s mission to revolutionize crypto engagement through user-owned value. Joined by CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill, Kumar shared insights into Layer3’s business model, future goals, and the broader trends shaping the crypto industry.Redefining User-Owned ValueLayer3’s core mission centers on \"user-owned value,\" a concept that flips the traditional advertising model on its head. Kumar explained, “When a user is spending time on Layer3, they're actually able to earn, in addition to discovering and finding protocols relevant to their needs and interests.” Unlike traditional platforms like Google or Facebook, which monetize user attention for corporate profit, Layer3 ensures users share the economic value generated from their activity.By fostering this shift, Layer3 provides users a more direct connection to protocols and projects within the crypto ecosystem. Kumar elaborated,“What we're trying to basically convey is this notion of a user who spends time but also earns economic value while being advertised to.”The Journey from Traditional Finance to CryptoKumar’s background in traditional finance significantly shaped his approach to Layer3. He previously worked at Accolade Partners, a prominent alternative asset manager, where he gained experience in venture capital and technology investments.“We looked at what was happening in crypto venture and said it resembles a lot of what was happening in the 80s and 90s within traditional venture capital,” Kumar noted.This unique perspective allowed Kumar to recognize the potential of the crypto space early on. He emphasized that his financial experience taught him the importance of robust business models and defensibility. “Understanding business models and thinking about them in a dispassionate way was essential,” he said, adding that the experience helped him make strategic choices in La\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nExploring decentralized AI and artistic innovation with Dimitri de Jong of 204.ai\n\nThe latest SlateCast episode featured Dimitri de Jong, founder and CTO of 204.ai, in conversation with Liam “Akiba” Wright, Editor in Chief of CryptoSlate, and Nate Whitehill, CEO of CryptoSlate. The discussion centered on de Jong’s innovative work at the intersection of AI, blockchain, and artistic expression. His experience spans decades of research and development in decentralized systems, blending technology with creative vision.From Microelectronics to AI and BlockchainDimitri’s journey began with a foundation in microelectronics and systems theory. As he explained, this background provided a deep understanding of complex systems and their optimization. His work in the 2010s revolved around using machine learning to simulate rare events and improve microchip designs for diverse environments, from space missions to nuclear reactors.“I specialized in systems theory and nonlinear systems to optimize designs in virtual environments,” said Dimitri. “That foundation translates directly into understanding decentralized systems.”This knowledge eventually led him to blockchain and AI, where he developed data sovereignty solutions such as Ocean Protocol, a decentralized data exchange, and Nevermind, focused on AI agents and data ownership.204.ai: Fusing Art and TechnologyDimitri described 204.ai as an “interactive design studio” where AI and artistic research converge. The studio explores immersive generative art, creating unique experiences like stepping into AI-enhanced paintings or witnessing fossils “come alive” through dynamic overlays.“We aim to make AI interactions multi-sensory and deeply engaging,” he said. “For example, we use brain-computer interfaces to enhance real-time generative designs.”204.ai’s work spans institutional projects and public-facing immersive experiences. From kinetic installations to AI-driven nature simulations, Dimitri emphasized the importance of bridging creative expression and technological advancement.The Vision of a Universal Recomme\n\n[Ad](https://cryptoslate.com/partnerships/)\n\n[![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2096%2096%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\\\\n\\\\\nCryptoSlate on Substackcryptoslate.substack.com\\\\\n\\\\\nEssential crypto updates and analyses.

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.\n\n1076 Views\n\nRussia has started using crypto for oil trades with China and India as it seeks to bypass Western sanctions, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-leans-cryptocurrencies-oil-trade-sources-say-2025-03-14/) on March 14, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n\nAccording to the report, some Russian oil companies have settled trades in [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/), [Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/), and stablecoins like Tether’s [USDT](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/). This strategy simplifies the conversion of Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupees into Russian Rubles, enabling smoother transactions despite financial restrictions.\n\nTypically, a Chinese buyer deposits Yuan into an offshore account controlled by an intermediary. The funds are then converted into crypto and transferred through multiple accounts before reaching a final destination in Russia, where they are exchanged for Rubles.\n\nThese transactions reportedly reach tens of millions of dollars per month.\n\nAlthough crypto adoption in Russia’s oil trade remains limited, it is [part of a broader trend](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-firms-turn-to-bitcoin-stablecoins-for-global-trade-amid-sanctions/). Over the past year, the country has [introduced new regulations](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-contemplating-permanently-legalizing-stablecoins-for-cross-border-payments/) governing [crypto mining](https://cryptoslate.com/russias-bitcoin-mining-demand-triples-amid-regulatory-shifts-and-price-rally/), taxation, and international trade.\n\n[Western sanctions imposed over Russia’s](https://cryptoslate.com/tether-freezes-27m-on-garantex-forcing-halt-of-russian-linked-exchange/) military actions in Ukraine have accelerated this shift toward digital assets. However, industry sources suggest oil firms may continue using cryptocurrencies even if sanctions are lifted due to their efficiency and transaction speed.\n\n## Digital rubles challenges\n\nWhile Russia increases its reliance on crypto for trade, its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project is facing significant hurdles.\n\nLast month, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina [announced](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-delays-digital-ruble-cbdc-launch-extends-pilot-phase-indefinitely/) an indefinite delay in the launch of the digital ruble. She attributed the setback to the need for further refinements to ensure that the currency benefits all stakeholders.\n\nHowever, a recent survey indicates that the digital ruble launch was postponed due to the inadequate IT infrastructure of banks that were expected to handle the project.\n\nThe survey of Russian banking experts revealed that 30% of financial institutions are not yet prepared to support the digital ruble. Experts explained that implementing the CBDC requires banks to upgrade their IT systems to handle increased transaction volumes.\n\nMeanwhile, 20% of banking IT specialists stated that their systems are fully equipped for the digital ruble. Another 50% said they are partially prepared but need further upgrades.\n\nAt the same time, around 14% of the respondents expressed concerns over potential information security risks associated with the currency.\n\nGiven these challenges, Russia’s national digital asset initiative could face further obstacles unless major financial institutions fully prepare for its adoption.\n\n###### Mentioned in this article\n\n[![Bitcoin](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/) [![Ethereum](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/) [![Tether](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Tether](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/) [![Tether Limited](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Tether Limited](https://cryptoslate.com/companies/tether/)\n\n[![XRP Turbo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201280%20453%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://link.cryptoslate.com/xrpturbo)\n\nPosted In: [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/news/bitcoin/), [China](https://cryptoslate.com/places/china/), [India](https://cryptoslate.com/places/india/), [Russia](https://cryptoslate.com/places/russia/), [Adoption](https://cryptoslate.com/adoption/), [Crypto](https://cryptoslate.com/crypto/), [Featured](https://cryptoslate.com/featured-news/)\n\nPeople were interested in these podcasts\n\n[Discover more podcasts →](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-oil-firms-using-bitcoin-and-ethereum-for-cross-border-payments-with-china/#)\n\nPlay Episode\n\n36min\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nDecentralizing AI infrastructure with Gaurav Sharma, CTO of io.net\n\nIn a recent SlateCast episode, Gaurav Sharma, CTO of io.net, joined CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill to discuss io.net’s groundbreaking approach to decentralized infrastructure for AI. With a background at tech giants like Binance and Amazon, Sharma brings deep expertise in scaling technology to a decentralized platform. io.net is paving the way for a decentralized ecosystem that aims to democratize access to AI resources, reduce costs, and enable greater innovation.The Vision Behind io.netSharma explained io.net’s role as a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) that leverages community-powered hardware.“Our inventory comes from the community,” Sharma noted. “We don’t own our hardware; we aggregate it from individuals, data centers, and companies.”This model drastically reduces user costs compared to centralized giants like Amazon Web Services (AWS).He highlighted the efficiency of this model:“For instance, an H100 GPU on a centralized platform might cost eight times more than what we offer. Our decentralized model empowers startups by cutting costs and enabling them to allocate resources toward innovation.”Challenges in Decentralized AI InfrastructureBuilding a decentralized AI system presents unique challenges. Sharma emphasized the need for robust distributed systems, scalability, and transparency.“Decentralized infrastructure cannot rely on monolithic tech stacks,” he explained. “The team must excel at distributed systems and computational fundamentals.”Moreover, latency sensitivity and scalability were critical from day one, as io.net’s users often come from high-demand enterprises. Sharma also stressed the importance of trust and transparency in the crypto ecosystem.“Our block explorer showcases every aspect of our network, from GPU availability to revenue metrics. Transparency is the foundation of trust,” he said.Empowering Developers Through TokenomicsOne of io.net’s core innovations is incentivizing co\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nBuilding the decentralized data layer with Powerloom’s Swaroop Hegde\n\nSwaroop Hegde, CEO and Co-Founder of Powerloom, joined CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief, Liam “Akiba” Wright, and CEO Nate Whitehill on The SlateCast to discuss the future of decentralized data layers. Backed by notable names like Blockchain Capital and Filecoin, Powerloom is setting a new standard for composable and decentralized data solutions, reshaping how users interact with on-chain data and fostering innovation across web3 applications.The Challenge of Reliable On-Chain DataSwaroop began by highlighting the current inefficiencies in accessing and verifying on-chain data. Traditional methods rely heavily on centralized sources, such as CoinMarketCap or specific blockchain dashboards, leading to potential data manipulation and outdated information.“Most of the usage when it goes outside of the dApp is actually coming from some sort of centralized indexer,”Swaroop noted, emphasizing the vulnerabilities inherent in such a setup.Powerloom addresses these issues with a decentralized node network, enabling real-time data computation without the need for a centralized intermediary.“With over 5,300 nodes, even non-technical users can contribute to the network, ensuring verifiability and reliability,” he explained.Powerloom’s Unique Approach to Data CompositionUnlike traditional indexers, Powerloom operates on a demand-driven system that aggregates data atomically. Swaroop explained,“We don’t sit and index all the data. Instead, we focus on composing data dynamically based on demand.”This approach allows Powerloom to cater to a variety of use cases, from trading data to lending rates across multiple chains.The platform’s composability extends beyond Uniswap and Aave, creating “data markets” that empower users to craft personalized queries and insights. These markets are decentralized and verifiable, ensuring users can trust the integrity of their data.Introducing Generative Prediction Markets (GPM)A standout feature discussed was Powerloom’s Generative Prediction Markets\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nHow Layer3 is reshaping on-chain user value - Brandon Kumar explains\n\nCryptoSlate’s SlateCast recently welcomed Brandon Kumar, co-founder of Layer3, to discuss the platform’s mission to revolutionize crypto engagement through user-owned value. Joined by CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill, Kumar shared insights into Layer3’s business model, future goals, and the broader trends shaping the crypto industry.Redefining User-Owned ValueLayer3’s core mission centers on \"user-owned value,\" a concept that flips the traditional advertising model on its head. Kumar explained, “When a user is spending time on Layer3, they're actually able to earn, in addition to discovering and finding protocols relevant to their needs and interests.” Unlike traditional platforms like Google or Facebook, which monetize user attention for corporate profit, Layer3 ensures users share the economic value generated from their activity.By fostering this shift, Layer3 provides users a more direct connection to protocols and projects within the crypto ecosystem. Kumar elaborated,“What we're trying to basically convey is this notion of a user who spends time but also earns economic value while being advertised to.”The Journey from Traditional Finance to CryptoKumar’s background in traditional finance significantly shaped his approach to Layer3. He previously worked at Accolade Partners, a prominent alternative asset manager, where he gained experience in venture capital and technology investments.“We looked at what was happening in crypto venture and said it resembles a lot of what was happening in the 80s and 90s within traditional venture capital,” Kumar noted.This unique perspective allowed Kumar to recognize the potential of the crypto space early on. He emphasized that his financial experience taught him the importance of robust business models and defensibility. “Understanding business models and thinking about them in a dispassionate way was essential,” he said, adding that the experience helped him make strategic choices in La\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nExploring decentralized AI and artistic innovation with Dimitri de Jong of 204.ai\n\nThe latest SlateCast episode featured Dimitri de Jong, founder and CTO of 204.ai, in conversation with Liam “Akiba” Wright, Editor in Chief of CryptoSlate, and Nate Whitehill, CEO of CryptoSlate. The discussion centered on de Jong’s innovative work at the intersection of AI, blockchain, and artistic expression. His experience spans decades of research and development in decentralized systems, blending technology with creative vision.From Microelectronics to AI and BlockchainDimitri’s journey began with a foundation in microelectronics and systems theory. As he explained, this background provided a deep understanding of complex systems and their optimization. His work in the 2010s revolved around using machine learning to simulate rare events and improve microchip designs for diverse environments, from space missions to nuclear reactors.“I specialized in systems theory and nonlinear systems to optimize designs in virtual environments,” said Dimitri. “That foundation translates directly into understanding decentralized systems.”This knowledge eventually led him to blockchain and AI, where he developed data sovereignty solutions such as Ocean Protocol, a decentralized data exchange, and Nevermind, focused on AI agents and data ownership.204.ai: Fusing Art and TechnologyDimitri described 204.ai as an “interactive design studio” where AI and artistic research converge. The studio explores immersive generative art, creating unique experiences like stepping into AI-enhanced paintings or witnessing fossils “come alive” through dynamic overlays.“We aim to make AI interactions multi-sensory and deeply engaging,” he said. “For example, we use brain-computer interfaces to enhance real-time generative designs.”204.ai’s work spans institutional projects and public-facing immersive experiences. From kinetic installations to AI-driven nature simulations, Dimitri emphasized the importance of bridging creative expression and technological advancement.The Vision of a Universal Recomme\n\n[Ad](https://cryptoslate.com/partnerships/)\n\n[![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2096%2096%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\\\\n\\\\\nCryptoSlate on Substackcryptoslate.substack.com\\\\\n\\\\\nEssential crypto updates and analyses.

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.\n\n1076 Views\n\nRussia has started using crypto for oil trades with China and India as it seeks to bypass Western sanctions, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-leans-cryptocurrencies-oil-trade-sources-say-2025-03-14/) on March 14, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n\nAccording to the report, some Russian oil companies have settled trades in [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/), [Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/), and stablecoins like Tether’s [USDT](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/). This strategy simplifies the conversion of Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupees into Russian Rubles, enabling smoother transactions despite financial restrictions.\n\nTypically, a Chinese buyer deposits Yuan into an offshore account controlled by an intermediary. The funds are then converted into crypto and transferred through multiple accounts before reaching a final destination in Russia, where they are exchanged for Rubles.\n\nThese transactions reportedly reach tens of millions of dollars per month.\n\nAlthough crypto adoption in Russia’s oil trade remains limited, it is [part of a broader trend](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-firms-turn-to-bitcoin-stablecoins-for-global-trade-amid-sanctions/). Over the past year, the country has [introduced new regulations](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-contemplating-permanently-legalizing-stablecoins-for-cross-border-payments/) governing [crypto mining](https://cryptoslate.com/russias-bitcoin-mining-demand-triples-amid-regulatory-shifts-and-price-rally/), taxation, and international trade.\n\n[Western sanctions imposed over Russia’s](https://cryptoslate.com/tether-freezes-27m-on-garantex-forcing-halt-of-russian-linked-exchange/) military actions in Ukraine have accelerated this shift toward digital assets. However, industry sources suggest oil firms may continue using cryptocurrencies even if sanctions are lifted due to their efficiency and transaction speed.\n\n## Digital rubles challenges\n\nWhile Russia increases its reliance on crypto for trade, its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project is facing significant hurdles.\n\nLast month, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina [announced](https://cryptoslate.com/russia-delays-digital-ruble-cbdc-launch-extends-pilot-phase-indefinitely/) an indefinite delay in the launch of the digital ruble. She attributed the setback to the need for further refinements to ensure that the currency benefits all stakeholders.\n\nHowever, a recent survey indicates that the digital ruble launch was postponed due to the inadequate IT infrastructure of banks that were expected to handle the project.\n\nThe survey of Russian banking experts revealed that 30% of financial institutions are not yet prepared to support the digital ruble. Experts explained that implementing the CBDC requires banks to upgrade their IT systems to handle increased transaction volumes.\n\nMeanwhile, 20% of banking IT specialists stated that their systems are fully equipped for the digital ruble. Another 50% said they are partially prepared but need further upgrades.\n\nAt the same time, around 14% of the respondents expressed concerns over potential information security risks associated with the currency.\n\nGiven these challenges, Russia’s national digital asset initiative could face further obstacles unless major financial institutions fully prepare for its adoption.\n\n###### Mentioned in this article\n\n[![Bitcoin](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/) [![Ethereum](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Ethereum](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/) [![Tether](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Tether](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/) [![Tether Limited](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)Tether Limited](https://cryptoslate.com/companies/tether/)\n\n[![XRP Turbo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201280%20453%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://link.cryptoslate.com/xrpturbo)\n\nPosted In: [Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/news/bitcoin/), [China](https://cryptoslate.com/places/china/), [India](https://cryptoslate.com/places/india/), [Russia](https://cryptoslate.com/places/russia/), [Adoption](https://cryptoslate.com/adoption/), [Crypto](https://cryptoslate.com/crypto/), [Featured](https://cryptoslate.com/featured-news/)\n\nPeople were interested in these podcasts\n\n[Discover more podcasts →](https://cryptoslate.com/russian-oil-firms-using-bitcoin-and-ethereum-for-cross-border-payments-with-china/#)\n\nPlay Episode\n\n36min\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nDecentralizing AI infrastructure with Gaurav Sharma, CTO of io.net\n\nIn a recent SlateCast episode, Gaurav Sharma, CTO of io.net, joined CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill to discuss io.net’s groundbreaking approach to decentralized infrastructure for AI. With a background at tech giants like Binance and Amazon, Sharma brings deep expertise in scaling technology to a decentralized platform. io.net is paving the way for a decentralized ecosystem that aims to democratize access to AI resources, reduce costs, and enable greater innovation.The Vision Behind io.netSharma explained io.net’s role as a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) that leverages community-powered hardware.“Our inventory comes from the community,” Sharma noted. “We don’t own our hardware; we aggregate it from individuals, data centers, and companies.”This model drastically reduces user costs compared to centralized giants like Amazon Web Services (AWS).He highlighted the efficiency of this model:“For instance, an H100 GPU on a centralized platform might cost eight times more than what we offer. Our decentralized model empowers startups by cutting costs and enabling them to allocate resources toward innovation.”Challenges in Decentralized AI InfrastructureBuilding a decentralized AI system presents unique challenges. Sharma emphasized the need for robust distributed systems, scalability, and transparency.“Decentralized infrastructure cannot rely on monolithic tech stacks,” he explained. “The team must excel at distributed systems and computational fundamentals.”Moreover, latency sensitivity and scalability were critical from day one, as io.net’s users often come from high-demand enterprises. Sharma also stressed the importance of trust and transparency in the crypto ecosystem.“Our block explorer showcases every aspect of our network, from GPU availability to revenue metrics. Transparency is the foundation of trust,” he said.Empowering Developers Through TokenomicsOne of io.net’s core innovations is incentivizing co\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nBuilding the decentralized data layer with Powerloom’s Swaroop Hegde\n\nSwaroop Hegde, CEO and Co-Founder of Powerloom, joined CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief, Liam “Akiba” Wright, and CEO Nate Whitehill on The SlateCast to discuss the future of decentralized data layers. Backed by notable names like Blockchain Capital and Filecoin, Powerloom is setting a new standard for composable and decentralized data solutions, reshaping how users interact with on-chain data and fostering innovation across web3 applications.The Challenge of Reliable On-Chain DataSwaroop began by highlighting the current inefficiencies in accessing and verifying on-chain data. Traditional methods rely heavily on centralized sources, such as CoinMarketCap or specific blockchain dashboards, leading to potential data manipulation and outdated information.“Most of the usage when it goes outside of the dApp is actually coming from some sort of centralized indexer,”Swaroop noted, emphasizing the vulnerabilities inherent in such a setup.Powerloom addresses these issues with a decentralized node network, enabling real-time data computation without the need for a centralized intermediary.“With over 5,300 nodes, even non-technical users can contribute to the network, ensuring verifiability and reliability,” he explained.Powerloom’s Unique Approach to Data CompositionUnlike traditional indexers, Powerloom operates on a demand-driven system that aggregates data atomically. Swaroop explained,“We don’t sit and index all the data. Instead, we focus on composing data dynamically based on demand.”This approach allows Powerloom to cater to a variety of use cases, from trading data to lending rates across multiple chains.The platform’s composability extends beyond Uniswap and Aave, creating “data markets” that empower users to craft personalized queries and insights. These markets are decentralized and verifiable, ensuring users can trust the integrity of their data.Introducing Generative Prediction Markets (GPM)A standout feature discussed was Powerloom’s Generative Prediction Markets\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nHow Layer3 is reshaping on-chain user value - Brandon Kumar explains\n\nCryptoSlate’s SlateCast recently welcomed Brandon Kumar, co-founder of Layer3, to discuss the platform’s mission to revolutionize crypto engagement through user-owned value. Joined by CryptoSlate’s Editor-in-Chief Liam “Akiba” Wright and CEO Nate Whitehill, Kumar shared insights into Layer3’s business model, future goals, and the broader trends shaping the crypto industry.Redefining User-Owned ValueLayer3’s core mission centers on \"user-owned value,\" a concept that flips the traditional advertising model on its head. Kumar explained, “When a user is spending time on Layer3, they're actually able to earn, in addition to discovering and finding protocols relevant to their needs and interests.” Unlike traditional platforms like Google or Facebook, which monetize user attention for corporate profit, Layer3 ensures users share the economic value generated from their activity.By fostering this shift, Layer3 provides users a more direct connection to protocols and projects within the crypto ecosystem. Kumar elaborated,“What we're trying to basically convey is this notion of a user who spends time but also earns economic value while being advertised to.”The Journey from Traditional Finance to CryptoKumar’s background in traditional finance significantly shaped his approach to Layer3. He previously worked at Accolade Partners, a prominent alternative asset manager, where he gained experience in venture capital and technology investments.“We looked at what was happening in crypto venture and said it resembles a lot of what was happening in the 80s and 90s within traditional venture capital,” Kumar noted.This unique perspective allowed Kumar to recognize the potential of the crypto space early on. He emphasized that his financial experience taught him the importance of robust business models and defensibility. “Understanding business models and thinking about them in a dispassionate way was essential,” he said, adding that the experience helped him make strategic choices in La\n\nCryptoSlate SlateCast\n\nExploring decentralized AI and artistic innovation with Dimitri de Jong of 204.ai\n\nThe latest SlateCast episode featured Dimitri de Jong, founder and CTO of 204.ai, in conversation with Liam “Akiba” Wright, Editor in Chief of CryptoSlate, and Nate Whitehill, CEO of CryptoSlate. The discussion centered on de Jong’s innovative work at the intersection of AI, blockchain, and artistic expression. His experience spans decades of research and development in decentralized systems, blending technology with creative vision.From Microelectronics to AI and BlockchainDimitri’s journey began with a foundation in microelectronics and systems theory. As he explained, this background provided a deep understanding of complex systems and their optimization. His work in the 2010s revolved around using machine learning to simulate rare events and improve microchip designs for diverse environments, from space missions to nuclear reactors.“I specialized in systems theory and nonlinear systems to optimize designs in virtual environments,” said Dimitri. “That foundation translates directly into understanding decentralized systems.”This knowledge eventually led him to blockchain and AI, where he developed data sovereignty solutions such as Ocean Protocol, a decentralized data exchange, and Nevermind, focused on AI agents and data ownership.204.ai: Fusing Art and TechnologyDimitri described 204.ai as an “interactive design studio” where AI and artistic research converge. The studio explores immersive generative art, creating unique experiences like stepping into AI-enhanced paintings or witnessing fossils “come alive” through dynamic overlays.“We aim to make AI interactions multi-sensory and deeply engaging,” he said. “For example, we use brain-computer interfaces to enhance real-time generative designs.”204.ai’s work spans institutional projects and public-facing immersive experiences. From kinetic installations to AI-driven nature simulations, Dimitri emphasized the importance of bridging creative expression and technological advancement.The Vision of a Universal Recomme\n\n[Ad](https://cryptoslate.com/partnerships/)\n\n[![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2096%2096%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\\\\n\\\\\nCryptoSlate on Substackcryptoslate.substack.com\\\\\n\\\\\nEssential crypto updates and analyses.
