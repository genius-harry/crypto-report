Other Ethereum-based memecoins pepe (PEPE) and mog (MOG), rose more than 5% — continuing to act as levered bets.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDon't miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today.

Tron’s TRX dipped after a surge 5% earlier in the day as memecoin trading picked up on the blockchain following a [no-fee update](https://www.coindesk.com/daybook-us/2025/03/19/crypto-daybook-americas-memecoins-take-off-on-tron-while-bitcoin-looks-to-fomc) in the Sunpump platform.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) rose 2% and remained steady under $84,000 in Asian evening hours ahead of the FOMC, where traders expect rates to be held steady. The $80,000 mark remains one to be watched, some say, as a break below would mean a critical support level vanishes.\n\nThe widely-watched ETH/BTC ratio - or the trading pair of ether against bitcoin - rose from 0.23 to 0.24 since Asian morning hours, indicative of a bump in demand for riskier ETH versus the perceived safety of bitcoin.\n\nEther rose on no immediate catalyst, but the mothership network has technical catalysts in the making. The Pectra upgrade, Ethereum's next major update, is currently in testing and aims to improve scalability, staking, and user experience with over 20 EIPs, including EIP-7702 (smart account functionality) and EIP-7251 (raising validator staking limits to 2,048 ETH).\n\nTesting began on Holesky in February 2025, followed by Sepolia in March, but faced challenges like transaction processing issues due to client incompatibilities. A new testnet, Hooli, launched on March 17, with Pectra testing scheduled for March 26.

Three of the most-watched (and most valuable) tokens today are **Bitcoin**(CRYPTO: BTC), **Ethereum**(CRYPTO: ETH) and **Dogecoin**(CRYPTO: DOGE). These digital assets have lost 2.9%, 2.8%, and 5.7%, respectively, over the past 24 hours as of 3 p.m. ET.\n\nThese moves have coincided with a broader pause in other risk assets ahead of what should be a very influential Federal Reserve decision tomorrow. But as is always the case with these high-flying assets, there's more to the story.\n\nLet's dive into some of the key drivers affecting demand for these three top cryptos today.\n\n## ETF flows generating outsized attention\n\nFollowing the post-Trump election victory, which saw Bitcoin rise to new all-time highs, and other top tokens like Ethereum and Dogecoin also see their fair share of upside, the performance of these top three cryptocurrencies has been overtly negative since Inauguration Day.\n\nSome of this depressed sentiment can be tied to spot ETF inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum. Among the notable reports I've seen come through is one detailing the surge of capital into gold-denominated ETFs and assets, with ETF outflows from various Bitcoin ETFs presumably flowing into these safe-haven funds.\n\nOne of the key investing theses held by long-term Bitcoin bulls (and to a certain extent, Ethereum holders as well) is that these digital assets carry some \"store of value\" properties that should provide demand even in the worst market environments. In fairness, we've yet to see how any cryptocurrency performs in a prolonged bear market (Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency, created in 2009 following the GFC).\n\nThat said, the fact that spot Bitcoin ETFs have given up their lead over gold ETFs (which was first gained late last year following the Trump election victory) is a trend worth noting. If more capital continues to flow out of this space, spot Ethereum ETFs (and future potential spot ETFs for Dogecoin and other assets) may have a much more negative outlook. Indeed, the recent news that two Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs are being liquidated by 21Shares adds to this narrative.\n\n## What to make of these recession concerns?\n\nI think the price action of all three major tokens today, and for the better part of the past two months, is really indicative of how investors view cryptocurrencies as an asset class in a potential recession. Right now, market participants are increasingly attempting to price new recession probabilities into their models. For top cryptos like these, their performance in a protracted downturn is really not known. That's adding to the uncertainty around owning these assets heading into what could be a turbulent back half of 2025.\n\nStory Continues\n\nI think Bitcoin and Ethereum should have plenty of long-term upside. But I'm also aware that these assets have posted multiple 50%-plus drawdowns in the past, on lesser news than concerns around a potential recession. So investors will have to hone in on their investing timeline and what sort of levels they'd consider buying these assets at first before jumping in with both feet.\n\nMy view of Dogecoin is that this meme token is more of a speculative tool for traders to play sentiment to the upside and downside. Today's outsized move lower is indicative of how this token trades (with plenty of leveraged derivatives positions in the background driving these volatile moves).\n\nIf you're of the mind that more downside is likely, buying the dip with the world's two most valuable cryptocurrencies may be the strategy of choice.\n\n## Should you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe _Motley Fool Stock Advisor_ analyst team just identified what they believe are the **[10 best stocks](https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&impression=55981e0d-3c7f-484c-855e-85f65022d943&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-sa-bbn-bn%3Faid%3D8867%26source%3Disaeditxt0001029%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Darticle_pitch_feed_yahoo%26ftm_pit%3D17177&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=9c34ac48-04cc-48dc-af8d-993ede4c9e44)** for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

Three of the most-watched (and most valuable) tokens today are **Bitcoin**(CRYPTO: BTC), **Ethereum**(CRYPTO: ETH) and **Dogecoin**(CRYPTO: DOGE). These digital assets have lost 2.9%, 2.8%, and 5.7%, respectively, over the past 24 hours as of 3 p.m. ET.\n\nThese moves have coincided with a broader pause in other risk assets ahead of what should be a very influential Federal Reserve decision tomorrow. But as is always the case with these high-flying assets, there's more to the story.\n\nLet's dive into some of the key drivers affecting demand for these three top cryptos today.\n\n## ETF flows generating outsized attention\n\nFollowing the post-Trump election victory, which saw Bitcoin rise to new all-time highs, and other top tokens like Ethereum and Dogecoin also see their fair share of upside, the performance of these top three cryptocurrencies has been overtly negative since Inauguration Day.\n\nSome of this depressed sentiment can be tied to spot ETF inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum. Among the notable reports I've seen come through is one detailing the surge of capital into gold-denominated ETFs and assets, with ETF outflows from various Bitcoin ETFs presumably flowing into these safe-haven funds.\n\nOne of the key investing theses held by long-term Bitcoin bulls (and to a certain extent, Ethereum holders as well) is that these digital assets carry some \"store of value\" properties that should provide demand even in the worst market environments. In fairness, we've yet to see how any cryptocurrency performs in a prolonged bear market (Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency, created in 2009 following the GFC).\n\nThat said, the fact that spot Bitcoin ETFs have given up their lead over gold ETFs (which was first gained late last year following the Trump election victory) is a trend worth noting. If more capital continues to flow out of this space, spot Ethereum ETFs (and future potential spot ETFs for Dogecoin and other assets) may have a much more negative outlook. Indeed, the recent news that two Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs are being liquidated by 21Shares adds to this narrative.\n\n## What to make of these recession concerns?\n\nI think the price action of all three major tokens today, and for the better part of the past two months, is really indicative of how investors view cryptocurrencies as an asset class in a potential recession. Right now, market participants are increasingly attempting to price new recession probabilities into their models. For top cryptos like these, their performance in a protracted downturn is really not known. That's adding to the uncertainty around owning these assets heading into what could be a turbulent back half of 2025.\n\nStory Continues\n\nI think Bitcoin and Ethereum should have plenty of long-term upside. But I'm also aware that these assets have posted multiple 50%-plus drawdowns in the past, on lesser news than concerns around a potential recession. So investors will have to hone in on their investing timeline and what sort of levels they'd consider buying these assets at first before jumping in with both feet.\n\nMy view of Dogecoin is that this meme token is more of a speculative tool for traders to play sentiment to the upside and downside. Today's outsized move lower is indicative of how this token trades (with plenty of leveraged derivatives positions in the background driving these volatile moves).\n\nIf you're of the mind that more downside is likely, buying the dip with the world's two most valuable cryptocurrencies may be the strategy of choice.\n\n## Should you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe _Motley Fool Stock Advisor_ analyst team just identified what they believe are the **[10 best stocks](https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&impression=55981e0d-3c7f-484c-855e-85f65022d943&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-sa-bbn-bn%3Faid%3D8867%26source%3Disaeditxt0001029%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Darticle_pitch_feed_yahoo%26ftm_pit%3D17177&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=9c34ac48-04cc-48dc-af8d-993ede4c9e44)** for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

Three of the most-watched (and most valuable) tokens today are **Bitcoin**( [BTC](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/btc/) 3.14%), **Ethereum**( [ETH](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/eth/) 3.89%) and **Dogecoin**( [DOGE](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/doge/) 3.82%). These digital assets have lost 2.9%, 2.8%, and 5.7%, respectively, over the past 24 hours as of 3 p.m. ET.\n\nThese moves have coincided with a broader pause in other risk assets ahead of what should be a very influential Federal Reserve decision tomorrow. But as is always the case with these high-flying assets, there's more to the story.\n\nLet's dive into some of the key drivers affecting demand for these three top cryptos today.\n\n## ETF flows generating outsized attention\n\nFollowing the post-Trump election victory, which saw Bitcoin rise to new all-time highs, and other top tokens like Ethereum and Dogecoin also see their fair share of upside, the performance of these top three cryptocurrencies has been overtly negative since Inauguration Day.\n\nSome of this depressed sentiment can be tied to spot ETF inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum. Among the notable reports I've seen come through is one detailing the surge of capital into gold-denominated ETFs and assets, with ETF outflows from various Bitcoin ETFs presumably flowing into these safe-haven funds.\n\nOne of the key investing theses held by long-term Bitcoin bulls (and to a certain extent, Ethereum holders as well) is that these digital assets carry some \"store of value\" properties that should provide demand even in the worst market environments. In fairness, we've yet to see how any cryptocurrency performs in a prolonged bear market (Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency, created in 2009 following the GFC).\n\nThat said, the fact that spot Bitcoin ETFs have given up their lead over gold ETFs (which was first gained late last year following the Trump election victory) is a trend worth noting. If more capital continues to flow out of this space, spot Ethereum ETFs (and future potential spot ETFs for Dogecoin and other assets) may have a much more negative outlook. Indeed, the recent news that two Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs are being liquidated by 21Shares adds to this narrative.\n\n## What to make of these recession concerns?\n\nI think the price action of all three major tokens today, and for the better part of the past two months, is really indicative of how investors view cryptocurrencies as an asset class in a potential recession. Right now, market participants are increasingly attempting to price new recession probabilities into their models. For top cryptos like these, their performance in a protracted downturn is really not known. That's adding to the uncertainty around owning these assets heading into what could be a turbulent back half of 2025.\n\nI think Bitcoin and Ethereum should have plenty of long-term upside. But I'm also aware that these assets have posted multiple 50%-plus drawdowns in the past, on lesser news than concerns around a potential recession. So investors will have to hone in on their investing timeline and what sort of levels they'd consider buying these assets at first before jumping in with both feet.\n\nMy view of Dogecoin is that this meme token is more of a speculative tool for traders to play sentiment to the upside and downside. Today's outsized move lower is indicative of how this token trades (with plenty of leveraged derivatives positions in the background driving these volatile moves).\n\nIf you're of the mind that more downside is likely, buying the dip with the world's two most valuable cryptocurrencies may be the strategy of choice.\n\n_[Chris MacDonald](https://www.fool.com/author/20447/) has positions in Ethereum.

This level roughly coincides with the daily resistance level at $85,000, making it a key resistance zone. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it trades around $82,600.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator suggests a strength in momentum on the daily chart. The lower low in the [Bitcoin](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin) price formed on March 11 does not reflect the RSI higher high for the same period. This development is termed a bullish divergence, often leading to a trend reversal or short-term rally.\n\nIf bullish divergence plays a part and BTC closes above its 200-day EMA at $85,496, it could extend the recovery to $90,000.\n\n![BTC/USDT daily chart](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/BTCUSDT_2025-03-19_07-31-37-638779502549626319.png)\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart\n\nHowever, if BTC corrects and closes below $78,258 (February 28 low), it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $73,072.\n\n## **Ethereum could recover if its $1,861 level continues to hold as support**\n\nEthereum price was retested, and support was found around its daily level at $1,861 since last week. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it is trading slightly above $1,930.\n\nIf the daily support around $1,861 holds, the ETH price could extend the recovery to retest its March 7 high of $2,258.\n\nThe RSI on the daily chart reads 36 after bouncing off its oversold level of 30 last week, indicating fading bearish momentum. However, the RSI must move above its neutral level of 50 for the recovery rally to be sustained.\n\n![ETH/USDT daily chart](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/ETHUSDT_2025-03-19_08-02-34-638779502943417861.png)\n\nETH/USDT daily chart\n\nOn the other hand, if ETH breaks and closes below the daily support at $1,861, it could extend the decline to retest the next support level at $1,700.\n\n## **XRP momentum indicator displays indecisiveness among the traders**\n\nRipple price retested its daily support of $1.96 on March 11 and recovered 10.14% in the next 4 days. However, it faced resistance around the 50-day EMA at around the $2.50 level on Saturday, declining 4.38% until Tuesday. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it trades at around $2.27.\n\nIf XRP breaks and closes above the 50-day EMA at $2.50, it could extend the recovery to retest its $2.72 level.\n\nThe RSI on the daily [chart](https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart) reads 46, hovering around the neutral level of 50, indicating indecisiveness among the traders. For the bullish momentum to be sustained, the RSI must move above its neutral level of 50\n\n![XRP/USDT daily chart](https://editorial.fxsstatic.com/miscelaneous/XRPUSDT_2025-03-19_08-09-53-638779503329467111.png)\n\nXRP/USDT daily chart\n\nHowever, if XRP faces a correction and closes below $1.96 daily support, it could extend an additional decline to test its February 3 low of $1.77.\n\n## Bitcoin, altcoins, stablecoins FAQs\n\n### What is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.\n\n### What are altcoins?\n\nAltcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.\n\n### What are stablecoins?\n\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.\n\n### What is Bitcoin Dominance?\n\nBitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin’s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.\n\n* * *\n\nShare: [Cryptos feed](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/feed)\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.\n\n### What are altcoins?\n\nAltcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.\n\n### What are stablecoins?\n\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.\n\n### What is Bitcoin Dominance?\n\nBitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin’s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.\n\n* * *\n\nShare: [Cryptos feed](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/feed)\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

However, stablecoins like **USDC** have seen remarkable inflows of capital. The coins, which are fixed in value, are growing in popularity as a sort of digital cash. Most stablecoins exist on a parent blockchain and Ethereum dominates the space. It was reported yesterday that Ethereum's four-month average trading volume for these stablecoins reached $850 billion. The continued dominance shows Ethereum is still holding its lead as the preferred \"smart contract\" blockchain as others have proliferated.\n\nArrows-OutExpand\n\n![](https://g.foolcdn.com/art/companylogos/mark/ETH.png)\n\n## [CRYPTO: ETH](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/eth/)\n\nEthereum\n\nToday's Change\n\n(3.89%) $75.24\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$2,008.86\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nYTD1w1m3m6m\n1y\n\n\n -45.02%\n\n\n5y\n\nPrice\n\nVS S&P\n\n\nETH\n\n\n### Key Data Points\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$242B\n\nDay's Range\n\n$1,932.04 - $2,067.11\n\n52wk Range\n\n$1,791.23 - $4,089.23\n\nVolume\n\n21,312,955,444\n\nAvg Vol\n\nGross Margin\n\n0.00%\n\nDividend Yield\n\nN/A\n\n## Dogecoin's new sponsorship\n\nThe House of Doge and Dogecoin Foundation, organizations that support and promote the cryptocurrency and meme coin, announced a new partnership today. The two are teaming up with IndyCar driver Devlin DeFrancesco and Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing to bring Dogecoin to the 109th running of the Indianapolis 500.\n\nThe Dogecoin Racing initiative will let fans vote on DeFrancesco's car design for the May 25 race, so long as the iconic Shiba Inu dog is at the center of the design. The partnership will also include a donation platform supporting a cause important to the team.\n\nThe Indianapolis 500 draws over 350,000 in-person spectators and many more around the world.

The reserve is still projecting modest GDP growth and relatively mild inflation, so fears of a recession or \"stagflation\" -- little to no GDP growth with high inflation -- were not echoed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. That's good news for now.\n\nHowever, Powell has indicated that the current environment makes predicting the future particularly difficult. There is a lot of uncertainty in the market at the moment. So, while recent developments helped boost the big three cryptocurrencies, they are still volatile assets, especially Dogecoin, a meme coin. They are highly sensitive to broader economic conditions and rising uncertainty. A looser regulatory environment could be offset by the uncertainty Trump's trade tariffs and foreign policy bring.\n\n_[Johnny Rice](https://www.fool.com/author/20621/) has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

That means that in most major economies, people and businesses buy, hold, and sell them, even if it isn't fully legal to do so. In many major countries, cryptocurrency exchanges are operating legally as well. But even fully legal exchanges within well-defined regulatory regimes can be used for illegal or otherwise less-than-wholesome purposes, like dodging international sanctions or [money laundering](https://www.fool.com/terms/m/money-laundering/).\n\nRussia extracts, refines, and sells a lot of oil. In terms of dollars, Russia's oil trade was worth $192 billion in 2024; the country's native currency is the ruble. Much of that trade is oil sales to India, which uses the rupee as its currency, and China, which uses the yuan. But due to international sanctions on Russia stemming from its war against Ukraine, selling oil in exchange for rupees or yuan directly is not as easy as it used to be, as it'd entail violating sanctions.\n\nSo now, per Reuters reporting in mid-March, Russian oil businesses are using Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies to facilitate their payments and evade the barriers to trade posed by the sanctions.\n\nTo illustrate how this process works, let's say that a company in India wants to buy oil from Russia. First, the company pays a sketchy middleman, typically a shell company, in rupees. Then, that middleman exchanges the rupees for Bitcoin, Ethereum, or a [stablecoin](https://www.fool.com/terms/s/stablecoins/). This is an action that is not in and of itself in violation of any sanctions, so it isn't inhibited in any way at the point of the exchange. Next, the cryptocurrency is sent to the Russian business selling oil. That business then sells its crypto to convert it into rubles.\n\nThe payment is cleared, and the oil is transferred accordingly, effectively skirting the sanctions. One Russian crypto exchange faced sanctions from the U.S. and European Union for facilitating this type of workaround in 2022. This ultimately led to it shutting down in early March of this year after some of its stablecoin [wallet addresses](https://www.fool.com/terms/b/blockchain-wallet/) were blocked by the coin's issuer. However, it's very likely that other exchanges are still in operation, and that more can spring up to take the fallen one's place.\n\nTherefore, investors should calculate that the sanctions evasion trade is more likely to continue using Bitcoin and Ethereum than it is with stablecoins moving forward. This will create buying pressure for those two coins for as long as the sanctions last, and perhaps even beyond that.\n\nThe force of that pressure may be substantial, depending on future demand for Russian oil.\n\nArrows-InCollapse\n\n![](https://g.foolcdn.com/art/companylogos/mark/ETH.png)\n\n## [CRYPTO: ETH](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/eth/)\n\nEthereum\n\nToday's Change\n\n(3.89%) $75.24\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$2,008.86\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nYTD1w1m3m6m1y\n5y\n\n\n+1364.87%\n\n\nPrice\n\nVS S&P\n\n\nETH\n\n\n### Key Data Points\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$242B\n\nDay's Range\n\n$1,932.04 - $2,067.11\n\n52wk Range\n\n$1,791.23 - $4,089.23\n\nVolume\n\n21,312,955,444\n\nAvg Vol\n\nGross Margin\n\n0.00%\n\nDividend Yield\n\nN/A\n\n## This could unravel explosively\n\nCryptocurrency's legal status in Russia is shifting in real time. Its central bank just implemented a three-year pilot program enabling wealthy investors to trade cryptos and derivative financial instruments. The ongoing process is bound to have implications for how the country's domestic businesses can use Bitcoin and Ethereum to avoid sanctions.\n\nThus, most investors shouldn't commit to buying significant quantities of Bitcoin and Ethereum based solely on the evasion trade. It's unclear how long Russia will be facing sanctions, so the buying pressure represented by its oil companies may taper off suddenly, causing prices to fall or be more volatile than usual. It's also unclear if there will be attempts at enforcing the sanctions, given the nature of the particular cryptos used.\n\nBut, like it or not, this saga supports one of the key pillars of Bitcoin's value, which is that it's a form of money that's not subject to the oversight of any one country in the way that [fiat currencies](https://www.fool.com/terms/f/fiat-currency/) are. If it were like fiat currencies and not independent of governments, there'd be a large probability of a central issuing authority blocking the wallet addresses of known sanctions evaders. The whole point of the Russian oil businesses using Bitcoin here is that there's not any authority to say they aren't allowed to do what they're doing. That confirmation of part of its [investment thesis](https://www.fool.com/terms/i/investment-thesis/) could be seen as another reason to buy it, provided that the intention is to hold it for the long term.\n\nWith Ethereum, this new driver is less relevant, and less likely to be sustained. While purchasing from sanction-dodgers could still generate higher prices over the coming months and perhaps even years, the existence of a relatively altruistic senior leadership team in the form of the Ethereum Foundation suggests that there might be some effort to adapt the chain such that it can't be used for nefarious purposes.\n\nIf you buy it to capture value from the evasion trade, the upside could be very short-lived, with a painful correction on the other side. Therefore, it isn't a good idea.\n\n_[Alex Carchidi](https://www.fool.com/author/20287/) has positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Bitcoin and Ethereum.

But sometimes, certain gargantuan investors, or groups of them, can bring so much capital to bear that their behavior is worth understanding in detail -- especially when they're accumulating relatively volatile assets like **Bitcoin**( [BTC](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/btc/) 3.14%) and **Ethereum**( [ETH](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/eth/) 3.89%).\n\nThere's one particular and relatively new pattern of behavior among a group of major investors that's important to know about. It might not push the prices of these coins up indefinitely, but it's already having an effect.\n\nArrows-InCollapse\n\n![](https://g.foolcdn.com/art/companylogos/mark/BTC.png)\n\n## [CRYPTO: BTC](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/btc/)\n\nBitcoin\n\nToday's Change\n\n(3.14%) $2,613.96\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$85,790.00\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nYTD1w1m3m6m1y\n5y\n\n\n+1246.94%\n\n\nPrice\n\nVS S&P\n\n\nBTC\n\n\n### Key Data Points\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$1.7T\n\nDay's Range\n\n$83,176.00 - $87,431.00\n\n52wk Range\n\n$49,221.15 - $108,785.53\n\nVolume\n\n37,621,849,558\n\nAvg Vol\n\nGross Margin\n\n0.00%\n\nDividend Yield\n\nN/A\n\n## Geopolitics are now undeniably a big part of crypto markets\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are assets with a global distribution. That means that in most major economies, people and businesses buy, hold, and sell them, even if it isn't fully legal to do so. In many major countries, cryptocurrency exchanges are operating legally as well. But even fully legal exchanges within well-defined regulatory regimes can be used for illegal or otherwise less-than-wholesome purposes, like dodging international sanctions or [money laundering](https://www.fool.com/terms/m/money-laundering/).\n\nRussia extracts, refines, and sells a lot of oil. In terms of dollars, Russia's oil trade was worth $192 billion in 2024; the country's native currency is the ruble. Much of that trade is oil sales to India, which uses the rupee as its currency, and China, which uses the yuan. But due to international sanctions on Russia stemming from its war against Ukraine, selling oil in exchange for rupees or yuan directly is not as easy as it used to be, as it'd entail violating sanctions.\n\nSo now, per Reuters reporting in mid-March, Russian oil businesses are using Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies to facilitate their payments and evade the barriers to trade posed by the sanctions.\n\nTo illustrate how this process works, let's say that a company in India wants to buy oil from Russia. First, the company pays a sketchy middleman, typically a shell company, in rupees. Then, that middleman exchanges the rupees for Bitcoin, Ethereum, or a [stablecoin](https://www.fool.com/terms/s/stablecoins/). This is an action that is not in and of itself in violation of any sanctions, so it isn't inhibited in any way at the point of the exchange. Next, the cryptocurrency is sent to the Russian business selling oil. That business then sells its crypto to convert it into rubles.\n\nThe payment is cleared, and the oil is transferred accordingly, effectively skirting the sanctions. One Russian crypto exchange faced sanctions from the U.S. and European Union for facilitating this type of workaround in 2022. This ultimately led to it shutting down in early March of this year after some of its stablecoin [wallet addresses](https://www.fool.com/terms/b/blockchain-wallet/) were blocked by the coin's issuer. However, it's very likely that other exchanges are still in operation, and that more can spring up to take the fallen one's place.\n\nTherefore, investors should calculate that the sanctions evasion trade is more likely to continue using Bitcoin and Ethereum than it is with stablecoins moving forward. This will create buying pressure for those two coins for as long as the sanctions last, and perhaps even beyond that.\n\nThe force of that pressure may be substantial, depending on future demand for Russian oil.\n\nArrows-InCollapse\n\n![](https://g.foolcdn.com/art/companylogos/mark/ETH.png)\n\n## [CRYPTO: ETH](https://www.fool.com/quote/crypto/eth/)\n\nEthereum\n\nToday's Change\n\n(3.89%) $75.24\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$2,008.86\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\nYTD1w1m3m6m1y\n5y\n\n\n+1364.87%\n\n\nPrice\n\nVS S&P\n\n\nETH\n\n\n### Key Data Points\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$242B\n\nDay's Range\n\n$1,932.04 - $2,067.11\n\n52wk Range\n\n$1,791.23 - $4,089.23\n\nVolume\n\n21,312,955,444\n\nAvg Vol\n\nGross Margin\n\n0.00%\n\nDividend Yield\n\nN/A\n\n## This could unravel explosively\n\nCryptocurrency's legal status in Russia is shifting in real time. Its central bank just implemented a three-year pilot program enabling wealthy investors to trade cryptos and derivative financial instruments. The ongoing process is bound to have implications for how the country's domestic businesses can use Bitcoin and Ethereum to avoid sanctions.\n\nThus, most investors shouldn't commit to buying significant quantities of Bitcoin and Ethereum based solely on the evasion trade. It's unclear how long Russia will be facing sanctions, so the buying pressure represented by its oil companies may taper off suddenly, causing prices to fall or be more volatile than usual. It's also unclear if there will be attempts at enforcing the sanctions, given the nature of the particular cryptos used.\n\nBut, like it or not, this saga supports one of the key pillars of Bitcoin's value, which is that it's a form of money that's not subject to the oversight of any one country in the way that [fiat currencies](https://www.fool.com/terms/f/fiat-currency/) are. If it were like fiat currencies and not independent of governments, there'd be a large probability of a central issuing authority blocking the wallet addresses of known sanctions evaders. The whole point of the Russian oil businesses using Bitcoin here is that there's not any authority to say they aren't allowed to do what they're doing. That confirmation of part of its [investment thesis](https://www.fool.com/terms/i/investment-thesis/) could be seen as another reason to buy it, provided that the intention is to hold it for the long term.\n\nWith Ethereum, this new driver is less relevant, and less likely to be sustained. While purchasing from sanction-dodgers could still generate higher prices over the coming months and perhaps even years, the existence of a relatively altruistic senior leadership team in the form of the Ethereum Foundation suggests that there might be some effort to adapt the chain such that it can't be used for nefarious purposes.\n\nIf you buy it to capture value from the evasion trade, the upside could be very short-lived, with a painful correction on the other side. Therefore, it isn't a good idea.\n\n_[Alex Carchidi](https://www.fool.com/author/20287/) has positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Bitcoin and Ethereum.
