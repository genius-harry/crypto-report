Pakistan appoints Changpeng Zhao as crypto adviser as adoption heats up Former Binance CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao has been appointed as an adviser to Pakistan\u2019s Crypto Council, a newly formed regulatory body tasked with overseeing the country\u2019s embrace of blockchain technology and digital assets. The appointment was confirmed by Pakistan\u2019s finance ministry and reported by Bloomberg on April 7. Zhao will advise the regulatory body on cryptocurrency regulation, infrastructure and adoption, Bloomberg reported. In March, the CEO of Pakistan\u2019s Crypto Council, Bilal bin Saqib, told Bloomberg that the country plans to develop a clear regulatory framework for digital assets. \u201cPakistan is done sitting on the sidelines,\u201d Saqib said. \u201cWe want to attract international investment because Pakistan is a low-cost high-growth market with [...] a Web3 native workforce ready to build.\u201d CZ is seen signing documents during his appointment by Pakistan\u2019s Ministry of Finance. Source: Business Recorder Whale makes $14 million Ether emergency deposit to avoid $340 million liquidation An unidentified cryptocurrency whale injected millions of dollars in emergency capital to avoid a potential liquidation of more than $300 million in Ether as markets slumped amid renewed macroeconomic pressure. The whale is reportedly close to liquidation on a 220,000 Ether ( ETH ) position on MakerDAO, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform. To stave off liquidation, the investor deposited 10,000 ETH \u2014 worth more than $14.5 million \u2014 and 3.54 million Dai ( DAI ) to raise the position\u2019s liquidation price, blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain said in an April 7 post on X. \u201cIf $ETH drops to $1,119.3, the 220,000 $ETH($340M) will be liquidated.\u201d Source: Lookonchain The development came hours after another Ether investor was liquidated for over $106 million on the decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Sky. The whale lost more than 67,000 ETH when the asset crashed by around 14% on April 6. Sky\u2019s system employs an overcollateralization ratio, typically 150% or higher, meaning that users need to deposit at least $150 worth of ETH to borrow 100 DAI. Bitcoin hashrate tops 1 zetahash in historic first The Bitcoin network hashrate has topped 1 zetahash per second (ZH/s) for the first time in Bitcoin\u2019s 16-year history, according to several blockchain data sources. Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate crossed the milestone on April 5 at a peak of 1.025 ZH/s, according to mempool.space data, while BTC Frame data said it hit 1.02 ZH/s a day earlier. Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate has fallen back below 0.95 ZH/s on April 7 since reaching 1 ZH/s. Source: BTC Frame Data from Coinwarz says that Bitcoin hashrate soared to as high as 1.1 ZH/s on April 4 at block height 890,915 \u2014 however, the same data indicates that Bitcoin first crossed 1 ZH/s on March 24. The Bitcoin network\u2019s reported rise to 1 ZH/s \u2014 equivalent to 1,000 Exahashes per second \u2014 marks a 1,000x increase since late January 2016, when Bitcoin first hit 1 EH/s for the first time. # Bitcoin # Altcoin # Ethereum # SEC # United States # Cybersecurity # Stablecoin # Liquidity # Whale # Regulation # Memecoin # Policy Add reaction",
